            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Character of the perſons ſpeaking in theſe Dialogues, as juſt and natural as it is, is not very common in this Age. They are two men perfectly neuters, in a controverſy wherein the world is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely divided: their main care is, to watch againſt all prejudices, that might incline them more to one party, than to the other: And they continue in this right diſpoſition of mind, in this evenneſs and equality of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, till their own ſtrict inquiries, ſagacity and judgment, with an exact diſcuſſion of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:174113:4"/>ſome deciſive points of fact turn the ſcales, and determine them to joyn with thoſe that have the truth on their ſide.</p>
               <p>The matter before them is, what men ought to think of the Provincial Letters, that famous book ſo eſteem'd, ſo decry'd; ſo commended, ſo deteſted; ſo uſeful to Chriſtianity, ſay ſome, ſo pernicious and ſo ſcandalous ſay others. The ſubject well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves attention: And that both the Jeſuits and their Adverſaries, and thoſe alſo that have declar'd for, or againſt either party, ſhou'd intereſt themſelves in the examination of an affair hitherto ſo little clear'd, or made plain.</p>
               <p>Many men of great quality having, for ſome years paſt, made that which is to be the ſubject of theſe Dialogues, the ſubject of their converſations, I might have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, without any improbability, or injury to truth, real perſons, whoſe names are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually known and illuſtrious; but the guſt or reliſh of our age, in this very different from that of old <hi>Rome,</hi> and old <hi>Greece,</hi> where the <hi>Craſſus's,</hi> the <hi>Catta's,</hi> the <hi>Socrates's,</hi> and the very authors themſelves under their own names us'd to be brought in ſpeaking in ſuch kind of works, obliges me to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method: and therefore thô they are the thoughts, reflexions, reaſonings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of Mr. .......... and Mr. ......... which are here ſet down, yet muſt it be under the names of <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that they are to be underſtood to ſpeak.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:174113:4"/>
               <p>A book publiſh'd three or four years ago was the occaſion of their firſt diſcourſe about the Provincial Letters: this book is call'd, <hi>Le Paralelle des Anciens &amp; des Modernes:</hi> but they were hinder'd, at it's firſt coming forth, from reading it, by a long voyage they had made out of the territories of <hi>France:</hi> as ſoon as they had read it throu', having made, as they went along, ſeveral reflexions according to their uſual cuſtom upon all new books, that are worth the while, <hi>Cleander</hi> put <hi>Eudoxus</hi> in mind of a paſſage, that had ſtartled them, the diſcuſſion of which they had put off to the end, becauſe it was like to be long, and that they had a mind, once for all, to ſatisfie themſelves fully upon that chapter. It was the paſſage in the ſecond tome, where the Provincial Letters are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and where all the perſons in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue conſpir'd to give thoſe Letters the greateſt commendation that ever was, or can be given of any work;

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174113:5"/>inoffenſive, never tranſgreſſing the Rules of decency and good manners; if there be more ſtrength and more art in his reaſonings, than in thoſe of <hi>Cicero:</hi> laſtly, if the art of Dialogue be found there whole and intire, ought not the ſmallneſs of the volume to be a commendation rather than a reproach? to ſpeak truth, we have nothing better in this kind of writing; have you read the latin tranſlation of them?</q>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:174113:6"/>only the ſtile is pure, the thoughts noble, the reaſoning ſolid, the raillery neat; but <hi>There is nothing but exactneſs, greatneſs, ſolidity, wit and grace.</hi> In one word, <hi>All the art of Dialogue is there whole and intire.</hi> They cannot more expreſly free them from all ſorts of faults, nor more fully include in them all manner of perfections. Mr. <hi>Perrault's</hi> Abbot has ſometimes without doubt the faculty of taſting and judging well; I am only afraid for him and Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> of hyperboles. That a million of men ſhou'd have read the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters, is certainly one, anſwers <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> which our language allows him: for the arithmetic of Grammarians is not ſo exact nor ſo ſcrupulous, as that of merchants and bankers. But for that which he adds, that among this infinite number of readers not one was wearied, he ought at leaſt to have excepted the Jeſuits, who I am confident had no great pleaſure in reading them.</p>
               <p>Why ſo? replies <hi>Eudoxus:</hi> I have ſeen many of 'um, who told me they had found that book very agreeable and diverting: not indeed, that they believ'd all that was there ſet down was true: for they pretend that his <hi>Railleries always decent and civil,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Perrault</hi> ſtiles them, are groſs and infamous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies: but yet, like men of wit they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd the turn and manner of expreſſion, which pleas'd them, from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which vex'd them.</p>
               <p>That in good earneſt is a pleaſant fancy, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:174113:6"/>I love them for it, ſays <hi>Cleander,</hi> that while all the world is made merry at their coſt, they themſelves ſhou'd ſhare in the diverſion; after the example of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who laugh'd as well as the other ſpectators, at <hi>Aristophanes's</hi> Comedies, where he himſelf was play'd upon, and made the ſubject of the ſport. And yet after all I believe if <hi>Paſcals</hi> Letters had no other judges or approvers but theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they wou'd run a great riſque of loſing part of their reputation. For which reaſon I think we ſhou'd do well to take other rules for criticiſing on this occaſion: and that, generally ſpeaking, the beſt that we can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in examining the works of <hi>Paſcal</hi> and his friends, and in examining the Jeſuits books, is not to give too much credit either to the one or to the other. There is good reaſon for exceptions againſt both; and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the affair in hand, rather than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is like one of thoſe knotty ſuites in law, wherein, by the number of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, recriminations, replys, and rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there appears nothing cleer of either ſide. The public was never more divided: half the world have declar'd that the Jeſuits are guilty of looſe morals: the other half look upon the Janſeniſts as detractors and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators, for decrying ſo conſiderable a body of the church, in revenge to the zeal they have ſhewn againſt their novelties and their errors. Thoſe who have only read the Provincial Letters are of the firſt opinion:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:174113:7"/>thoſe that have read but the Jeſuits anſwers are of the other; but for my part, who have read both, I know not yet what to think. Let us begin there, if you pleaſe: this is the chief point, or almoſt the only one we have to examin: for as to the politeneſs, the elegance, the wit and the purity of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I believe we ſhall both be of Mr. <hi>Perrault's</hi> opinion.</p>
               <p>What, ſays <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> briskly interrupting him, I am not at all ſatisfi'd with you, at the very moment you caution againſt prejudice, and ſhew the evil of it, do you your ſelf give into it; and immediately, without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſubſcribe to the moſt extraordinary panegyric that ever was made of any book written in our language? the greater, the more pompous, and the more unreſtrain'd the commendation is, the more it ought to be ſuſpected: and I do own, that it wou'd be a ſenſible pleaſure to me, to find ſome ſpots in this Sun, which they wou'd have me look upon as the pure fountain of light.</p>
               <p>When the prepoſſeſſion becomes general, replys <hi>Cleander,</hi> it ought no longer to paſs under that name; at leſt in the ill ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is commonly given to the word. There is nothing but truth, evident truth, that can make it's way throu', and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to all the world. And you your ſelf do agree with me, that there are none, not excepting even the Jeſuits, that do not do <hi>Paſcal</hi> juſtice; upon the point, wherein I deſire your concurrence.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:174113:7"/>
               <p>The maxim you advance, anſwers <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> how true and general ſoever it may ſeem, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ſome exceptions, moſt eſpecially in works of the underſtanding. I allow that no book coud ever have an univerſal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant approbation, which was not extreamly well writ. The caſe of that, and of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Court and of the City, is one and the ſame: a talent that is but common and indifferent, by whatever faction or party it may happen to be cry'd up and ſupported, will moſt certainly, early or late, fall to the ground: on the contrary, a vogue or reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, follow'd with a crowd of hearers, and increaſing, inſtead of diminiſhing, with the length of time, is a manifeſt conviction of an extraordinary merit, but as there are ſeveral degrees of excellence, I preſume that a work, excellent in the main, being once ſuppos'd to be ſuch, may afterwards, by the ſtrength and power of prejudice and prepoſſeſſion, paſs for moſt excellent and incomparable. How many old authors are there, whoſe very faults are eſteem'd, and even their negligences admir'd rather than cenſur'd? has not this been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by our author of the <hi>Parallele des An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens &amp; des Modernes,</hi> and by ſome critics a little bolder than the reſt? and how do we know that this is not the good fortune of the Provincial Letters, and that Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> being once allow'd to write well, and that in his work there was art, cloſe tranſitions, neat expreſſions, a great deal of wit, and a great
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:174113:8"/>deal of ornament, men took not up an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>That there is nothing but purity in the language, nobleneſs in the thoughts, fineſs in the railleries, and all over ſuch a grace as is hardly to be found elſewhere: that the art of Dialogue is there preſerv'd whole and intire; and that there is nothing better extent in this kind of writing.</hi> Indeed I wou'd not willingly ingage my ſelf to ſhew you faults in every page, nor make a liſt of all his ill expreſſions, as long as that which the author <hi>Des entretiens d'</hi> Ariſte <hi>&amp; d'</hi> Eugene, ſometimes ſince made, of thoſe found in the tranſlation of <hi>Thomas à Kempis De l'imitation de Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> another preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded maſter-piece, every where preach'd up for a model of the purity of our language; but perhaps as we go along I may find enuff to make you abate ſomewhat, in theſe very points, of the high thoughts you have of theſe Letters.</p>
               <p>You coud not do me a greater pleaſure, replys <hi>Cleander,</hi> and I freely confeſs the fault I have committed againſt our main maxim; and to make uſe of the author of the <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lele's</hi> expreſſion, in the paſſage we have juſt now read, you have ſurpris'd me <hi>In the very fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſo natural, ſays <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> to ſuffer our ſelves to be carry'd away with the ſtream, that it is not without much difficulty and reflexion, that we can maſter our inclinations to raſh judgment; we are naturally prone to judge of every thing, and at the ſame time
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174113:8"/>to hate that application which is neceſſary to do it well; and ſo fond are we of truth, that we immediately leap at, and almoſt never fail to take any thing for truth, which has but the leaſt ſhadow or appearance of it. But you muſt know, that there never were more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contrivances, nor more traps lay'd to catch men, than there have been in this very matter: both ſides cry out, have a care of prejudices, judge of the things only by pure reaſon, by experience, and the matters of fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My dear reader, ſays <hi>Wendrock,</hi> in the preface to his latin tranſlation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters; I beg the favor of you that you wou'd come prepar'd to read this book with a pure and unprejudic'd mind; and to judge of it rather by your own inſight and reaſon, than by the knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any other; give me leave only to advertiſe you, that, in caſe you have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd your ſelf to be prepoſſeſt againſt theſe Letters, by the clamors of the Jeſuits, it is but juſt, that before you begin them, you ſhou'd lay aſide all your prejudices, as every prudent reader ought to do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the other hand, the Jeſuits Apologiſt crys as loud as he can in his readers ear. <q>My dear reader, let not the writer of theſe Letters ſurprize you; or if he has already done it, let him no longer abuſe your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity; which advice I think my ſelf oblig'd to give you.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:174113:9"/>
               <p>That is to ſay, ſays <hi>Cleander</hi> interrupting him, that both ſides, by much exclaiming and adviſeing againſt prejudices, do all they can to fill us with prepoſſeſſions; and by ſeeming to give us an antidote againſt poiſon, endeavour to make us ſwallow the poiſon it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Very right, anſwers <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and in ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions as theſe both parties ſeldom fail of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ends, when either of them is heard without the other.</p>
               <p>But I foreſee, ſays <hi>Cleander,</hi> that to judge of the preſent matter, with that equity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs you pretend, we ſhall have need of more than one Library. For I have not in mine, nor I fancy have you in yours, <hi>Eſcobar, Fagundez, Della-Cruz, Vera-Cruz</hi> and all the reſt, whoſe very names ſo frighten'd <hi>Montaltius,</hi> that he had much a do to believe they were Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>We ſhall have no want of that, anſwers <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> I have a friend, a Janſeniſt, who has all the Caſuiſts of the Society, and who will be delighted to ſhew them to us. But I do not believe we ought to begin there: before we come to the diſcuſſion of the paſſages in the Jeſuit Divines, there are ſome general points, upon which we may argue without the help of a library. One of which, is <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal's</hi> Syſtem of the Jeſuits policy, to make themſelves maſters of the people's conſciences, not for the greater glory of God, but for the greater glory of the Society. It is an article of large extent, and many things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:174113:9"/>upon it: and in the Provincial Letters great care is taken, that the readers ſhou'd never loſe it quite out of ſight: and if we take <hi>Wendroks</hi> word, this is properly the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſubject matter of theſe Letters: this you may ſee by the title he has given his latin tranſlation.

With all my heart, ſays <hi>Cleander,</hi> and you may depend upon it, that I will do it with all poſſible exactneſs, and all the care imaginable.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd, anſwers <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that theſe Letters have given the Jeſuits repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation a terrible wound; and that they have debauch'd and drawn away from them a vaſt number of their friends, in Court, City and Country. Nor has any thing more increas'd the number of their adverſaries: never was there a diverſion made to better purpoſe, nor with greater effect than this. That book alone has made more Janſeniſts, than <hi>Janſenius's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinus,</hi> and all Mr. <hi>Arnauld's</hi> books together.</p>
               <p>This book has yet done more, adds <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> it has made in <hi>France</hi> a kind of a third party, which ſhall be mine, in caſe <hi>Montaltius</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:174113:10"/>be not found to impoſe upon the Jeſuits: it is of thoſe, who abhorring novelties in the diſpute of Grace, and in all other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted points, ſubmit themſelves ſincerely to the Church, without wrangling by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere diſtinction of Fact and Right; and who likewiſe cannot bear the relaxation of morals, wherewith the Jeſuits are reproach'd: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my word this party is almoſt as numerous as the other two.</p>
               <p>Without doubt it ought to be very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſays <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and I look upon it to be ſomewhat like that, which was in <hi>France</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV's. Reign, whilſt he continu'd a Hugonot. The Zeal of Religion on one ſide, and the unjuſt pretenſions of the Leaguers on the other, made an infinity of perſons ſtand neuters, and hinder'd them from declaring either for the League, or for the King, before he imbrac'd the Religion of his Anceſtors. But I much doubt whether the converſion of the Jeſuits wou'd have as good an effect for them, as that of the King had for himſelf; and whether their innocence, if fully clear'd, wou'd wholly turn that party to their ſide. The indifferent, and the well minded honeſt people wou'd do them juſtice: but how many are there who follow this third party, either becauſe they were not conſider'd, nor courted by the Janſeniſts, nor by the Jeſuits; or becauſe, how nice ſoever they are about the article of faith, they are not ſo in the article of charity?</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:174113:10"/>
               <p>How many think you are there, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining, as exactly as we intend to do, the accuſations againſt the Jeſuits, have no other ground, nor other reaſon for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious judgments they paſs upon their doctrin, but the authority of the Provincial Letters; or the authority of ſome perſons, who have taken no more pains than they, to inform themſelves of the truth? how few in the world have taken care to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from being ſurpriz'd in this matter, either by reading the Jeſuits anſwers, which they have not ſo much as look'd into; or by examining and comparing the paſſages, which theſe Fathers maintain were alter'd, mangled and tranſpos'd; or by certain reflexions natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enuff, which ought to have hinder'd them from precipitating their judgment, in things of this nature and importance? believe me, that men, who in the ſame kind of offices and employments emulate or ſtrive to outdo each other, men who in the Schools maintain and defend contrary opinions, and men who being of the ſame community or ſociety, do greatly love it's fame and reputation, and wiſh it might out-ſhine and excel all others, are very prone to paſs a raſh judgment on the affairs of ſuch, as may ſtand in their way, and give them any jealouſy, or obſtruct their glory or advancement. They are neither the rules of prudence, nor of the ſtricteſt morals which are then always follow'd: but however it be, the Jeſuits will for a long time, feel the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:174113:11"/>effects of the blow the Janſeniſts have given them.</p>
               <p>It is certain, anſwers <hi>Cleander,</hi> that the Gentlemen of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> ſhew'd themſelves Maſters in the art of policy and cunning: they were very near their ruin; the doctrin of <hi>Janſenius</hi> had been condem'd at <hi>Rome;</hi> the condemnation receiv'd with all poſſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not only in <hi>France,</hi> but likewiſe over all the Catholic Church; and the King, by an expreſs Declaration, directed to all the Prelats of the Kingdom, had commanded the publication and execution of it: he had ſent the Popes Decree to the <hi>Paris</hi> Divines in <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and an order in writing by Mr. <hi>de la Mothe Hodencourt,</hi> the then Biſhop of <hi>Rennes,</hi> that they ſhou'd take care, for the time to come, that nothing, thô never ſo little devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from this rule of Faith, ſhou'd be taught or advanc'd, either in Theſes or Leſſons by the Doctors or Batchelers of their Society. Upon this order, they made a decree, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting all Doctors and Batchelers from teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or defending any of the propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem'd, upon pain of being expell'd the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. The Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> then aſſembled at <hi>Paris,</hi> had written to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the X. upon the concluſion of this important affair, Letters of thanks and congratulation, ſigned by Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> and all the other Prelats. The diſtinction of Fact and Right, which ſeem'd to be the parties laſt reſſource, was, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after, deteſted, by another Aſſembly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:174113:11"/>of the Clergy, as a wicked evaſion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious artifice of the <hi>Port-Royal's,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh, inſenſibly, their errors. Nor cou'd there poſſibly be any thing better done, to confound and break all this party's meaſures, than the circular Letter written, upon this occaſion, by the Biſhops of this Aſſembly, to all the reſt of the Biſhops of the Kingdom; and their Letter, which, preſently after, they ſent to the Pope, to acquaint his Holineſs with this new difficulty and contrivance.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Arnauld's</hi> propoſition, <hi>That the Goſpel points us out a juſt Man in the perſon of Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>who upon an occaſion wanted Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it cannot be ſayd that he did not Sin:</hi> after ſeveral conſultations in <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> was condem'd and declar'd raſh, wicked, blaſphemous, already anathematiz'd and heretical: he himſelf turn'd out of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> with diſgrace, his name blotted out of the Catalogue of Doctors, and by the ſame decree, all that ſhou'd come into their aſſemblies, and all the Batchelers, that, for the future, ſhou'd hold Divinity acts, were oblig'd to ſubſcribe to this cenſure and condemnation. In a word, there never was any party more ſcurvily handled and run down, than this was, both by the Eccleſiaſtic, and by the Secular powers. When theſe cunning men, all on a ſudden, altering the Scene chang'd the whole face of things; and at the ſame time that ſome pittied, others blam'd, and not a few affronted them, and rejoyc'd at their condition, they fell upon acting a Comedy, that made the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:174113:12"/>forget all that had newly paſt; they ſtarted a freſh game, and put a tric upon the Public almoſt without their perceiving it; and made them hunt the Jeſuits, upon whom turning ſhort they fell with violence, fury and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; having at firſt made a ſhew, as if their deſign had been to run down the <hi>Sorbonne;</hi> they put them upon the defenſive, and puſh'd them home ſo briskly, that they got ground, and gain'd the applauſes of many, who a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had no thoughts for them, but of rage and indignation. Infine many, after they had, for ſome time, look'd upon them as corrupters of the faith, were inſenſibly drawn in, to conſider them as the great defenders and reſtorers of Chriſtian Morals, and the diſciplin of the Church.</p>
               <p>As, far as I perceive, replies <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> you are well inſtructed in this hiſtory.</p>
               <p>I was that year at <hi>Paris,</hi> anſwers <hi>Cleander,</hi> where I finiſh'd my Studies in the Law. I had ſome friends among both parties, which made me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, more then ever, the curioſity I always had to know what paſſes in ſuch kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. I knew a great deal of the intrigues of both ſides, and I cou'd at that time have written admirably well the hiſtory of Janſeniſme.</p>
               <p>Since it is ſo, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> recollect I pray you the particular hiſtory at leaſt of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Letters, and tell me all the circumſtances of that whole affair. This perhaps may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful towards inſtructing us in the cauſe now in hand. With all my heart, anſwers <hi>Cleander,</hi> I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:174113:12"/>remember them very well, and can ſatisfie you immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Arnould</hi> perceiv'd, that all the ſerious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies he cou'd make for <hi>Janſenius</hi> and himſelf, cou'd never miſs of being ſeriouſly examin'd; he was likewiſe well ſatisfi'd, whatever good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he had of his own abilities; that having the Pope upon his back, the King, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>France,</hi> the Aſſemblies of the Clergy, the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> all the Univerſities, and all the Communities (for Janſeniſme was every where anathematiz'd) he coud not be long able to ſupport the cauſe. It is hard for a man to have ſo many accuſers, to except againſt ſo many judges, to loſe his cauſe in ſo many Courts, and yet all this notwithſtanding to perſuade the world that he is ſtill innocent. Being then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very point of falling into a more grievous misfortune than ever he had met in all his life, that is, of being driven out of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> with the qualities of a dangerous fellow, a diſturber of the public, an opiniator and a heretic, he fram'd a deſign, not to put by the blow, this he ſaw was unavoidable, but to make it matter of ſport to himſelf and friends; and to contrive things ſo, that the public might laugh at it; in hopes that the people weary of the difficult queſtions, which, for a long time, had buſied the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> they might perhaps willingly take that occaſion to divert themſelves; and that then poſſibly the farce might blot out all the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the precedent ſerious Scene had left. And this it was, that occaſion'd the publiſhing of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:174113:13"/>the firſt Letter to the Provincial: who was not a Jack of Lent, a man in the clouds, as many believ'd, but a real perſon Mr. <hi>Perier</hi> by name, Counſellor in the Court of Exchequer at <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> in <hi>Auvergue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know what he was, ſays <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, it was he, that made the famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the quickſilver upon the Mountain <hi>Puy de Damme,</hi> at the entreaty of his brother-in-law Mr. <hi>Paſcal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very ſame, anſwers <hi>Cleander;</hi> but althô there are eighteen Letters, under the title of Letters to one in the country, and which at this day paſs under the name of Mr. <hi>Paſcal,</hi> yet were they not all written to that one and the ſame man: nor is it certain, as ſome will have it, that they were all writ by Mr. <hi>Paſcal.</hi> You your ſelf may remember, that only the firſt ten are directed to the Country Gentleman. The ſix which next follow, were written to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers the Jeſuits, and the two laſt to Father <hi>Annat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know that, ſays <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> but I am ſurpriz'd at what you tell me, that it is not certain, that all the eighteen Letters are Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi>'s. You ſee that Mr. <hi>Perrault,</hi> in his Dialogues, makes him the author of them all without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. <hi>It is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the illuſtrious Mr.</hi> Paſcal <hi>with his eighteen Provincial Letters.</hi> And he that writes the ſeventeenth Letter declares himſelf the author of the preceding ſixteen. <hi>Wendrok</hi> alſo in his latin tranſlation ſeems, every where to ſuppoſe, they were all the products
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174113:13"/>of one pen; what then can make you doubt it?</p>
               <p>I have ſeen, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> ſome Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript memoirs, by which it appears, that the three firſt Letters were Mr. <hi>Arnauld's;</hi> and where it is alſo added, that this Doctor having ſent them to Mr. <hi>Paſcal,</hi> thô at that time there was ſome little miſunderſtanding between them, Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> judg'd it not advantagious, to carry on the raillery farther in ſuch abſtracted ſubjects, as were treated of in thoſe Letters: that in order to engage, or amuſe the public, it was neceſſary to find ſomething more material, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible: that the Caſuiſts deciſions, was a much fitter ſubject for ſuch kind of pleaſantries, and that it was not difficult, to expoſe and bring them into play. Whereupon he propos'd to him, in general, a Scheme how the work might be carried on: which was ſo very pleaſing to Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> and all the <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> that they wholly left to him their intereſts, as well the manner and conduct, as the execution of this affair: ſo that in a little time after, that is to ſay, about the end of <hi>February</hi> 1656, the fourth Letter under the former title appear'd; which was the firſt of <hi>Paſcal</hi>'s, according to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which I will not warrant, conſidering the teſtimonies you have produc'd, of Mr. <hi>Perrault,</hi> of <hi>Wendrok,</hi> that is to ſay, of Mr. <hi>Nicole,</hi> and of the ſeventeenth Letter. And indeed the very ſtile of the three firſt Letters determins me to follow the common opinion: for there is in them too much lightneſs and humor, to come
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174113:14"/>from Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> and too much gall and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, to fall from the pen of this Doctor.</p>
               <p>However it be, it is alſo pretended, that notwithſtanding the great ſucceſs of this fourth Letter, the Knight of <hi>Meree</hi> advis'd <hi>Paſcal</hi> to lay aſide abſolutly the matter of Grace, which was alſo handled in this, althô in reference to Morals, and to give himſelf a greater latitude, than that ſubject wou'd allow of: an advice, which he willingly follow'd to the Jeſuits coſt; whom he made anſwerable, in ſpite of all they cou'd ſay in their own defence, for the moſt odious and moſt extravagant things in point of Morals, contain'd in the Satyr againſt the Caſuiſts.</p>
               <p>Theſe indeed are conſiderable particularities, ſays <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and of which very few are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. I have yet more curious and more certain ones to acquaint you with, continues <hi>Cleander,</hi> you know what our writers of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do commonly practiſe, before they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their works to the judgment of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; they have their friends and approvers, who are ſure to cry them up; among whom there is, commonly, ſome Lady of the firſt rank for wit and quality, who takes upon her ſelf the fate and ſetting off of the play: and points out before hand to her friends, all the ſeveral places they are to clap and admire. It was concluded very fit and convenient, not to neglect this innocent kind of artifice, to help forward the ſucceſs of the Provincial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Nevers</hi> houſe, now the Pallace of <hi>Conti,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:174113:14"/>was then the meeting place of the wittieſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and the moſt accompliſh'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thither, by the extraordinary civility, genteelneſs and magnificence of Madam <hi>du Pleſſis Guenegaud</hi> the Secretary of State's Lady. The Gentlemen of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> with whom this Lady entertain'd a great correſpondence, pitch'd upon her to bring the Provincial Letters into reputation, even before they were publiſh'd. Thoſe who ofteneſt waited upon her, were the Abbot of ........ who at that time was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for his wit and merits, but yet had not then thought of writing a book <hi>Of the duties of a Monaſtic Liſe.</hi> Mr. ........ and Mr. ........ both afterwards Counſellors of State, and famous for their ſuperintendencies, and their Ambaſſys. Mr. ........ then a Hugenot, <hi>Joucquet</hi> the ſuperintendent's favorit, and ſome others. To theſe ſhe read the ſixth Letter, which had been ſent to her in manuſcript, and did not forget as they came in her way, to make them take notice of all the excellencies ſhe her ſelf had before obſerv'd in it.</p>
               <p>You will eaſily believe, that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did not refuſe to give in their ſuffrages, not one of them was wanting in his duty on this occaſion. The praiſes they every where gave this Letter made all the world impatient to ſee ſo great a maſter-piece; which ſoon after appear'd; and from <hi>Paris</hi> quickly ſpread it ſelf over all the Provinces of the Kingdom; where it made ſuch a clutter, ſuch a hurly burly as put the Fathers of the Society into no ſmall conſternation.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:174113:15"/>
               <p>The Poſt never had ſo good a time on't, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him: copies of it were ſent to all the Cities of <hi>France:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô I was very little known to the Gentlemen of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> I receiv'd from them a great packet, poſt paid, in a City of <hi>Britany</hi> where I then was. I imparted the contents to my friends, and we read the Letter with a great deal of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>They took almoſt the ſame method for the following Letters, anſwers <hi>Cleander;</hi> the ſeventh by that means, got as far as into Cardinal <hi>Mazarin's</hi> hands, who, as all others did, laugh'd at it very heartily. The eighth came not out till the following month, on purpoſe, it ſeems, to have it wiſh'd for: for every thing relating to this matter ſeem'd to be carried on with great art, care and circumſpection. Very few knew for certain the hand from whence theſe Letters came: all others did but gueſs at the Author. The honor of them was given to Mr. <hi>de Gomberville,</hi> and this report was ſpread all over <hi>Paris:</hi> but he freed himſelf from it, by a letter he writ to his friend, Father <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon,</hi> at that time, Rector of the Jeſuits College.</p>
               <p>In the mean time this mighty ſucceſs did not hinder a great many, after their ſport and fit of laughter was over, from making ſome very ſerious reflexions; nor from being ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd at the outragious manner wherein the Jeſuits were rail'd at, and the reputation of a Society torn to pieces, which till then had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:174113:15"/>not only paſs'd for men of exemplary lives and good manners, but alſo of eminent and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox learning. The very Marchioneſs of <hi>Sablé</hi> thô at that time very much in the intereſts of the <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> cou'd not one day refrain from asking <hi>Paſcal,</hi> if he were very certain that all he had written in his Letters was true: for if all there ſayd be not true, with what conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſays ſhe, can you publiſh them, and every where decry ſo conſiderable a body as that of the Jeſuits? <hi>Paſcal</hi> anſwer'd her, that it was their buſineſs who furniſh'd him with the memoires to take care of that, and not his, who did but order and put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I know this particular point to be true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues <hi>Cleander,</hi> from two very worthy perſons of good credit to whom the Marchioneſs of <hi>Sablé</hi> her ſelf recounted it, more then once, in the later years of her life.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Paſcal</hi> did not act very conformably to the principles of ſevere Morals: nor do I know, that he cou'd find any one, in thoſe principles he calls looſe or relax'd, which, in an affair of this nature, wou'd have allow'd him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon, or govern himſelf, by the eyeſight and fidelity of another: eſpecially knowing full well, that thoſe, who gave him the papers, were declar'd enemies to the Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> after the tenth, the following Letters were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pure attacks: for by this time <hi>Paſcal</hi> was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:174113:16"/>oblig'd to put himſelf upon the defenſive: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Jeſuits pretended, they had convinc'd the <hi>Port-Royal</hi> of a great number of falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and impoſtures, upon which, it wou'd not have conſiſted with their honor, to have been altogether ſilent. Mr. <hi>Nicole,</hi> under the name of <hi>Wendrok,</hi> ſoon after runs in, to their ſuccor, or rather was put on, or let looſe by the party, to finiſh and compleat the ruin and defeat of the Jeſuits. He begun, in a very loud and high tone, the latin commentaries, which he added to his tranſlation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters; and in them treats the Jeſuits like a company of ſad and miſerable wretches. In a word, the whole contrivance ſucceeded, even beyond the contrivers own expectations. And thus you have a brief account of all I know, concerning the hiſtory of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Letters: of which, nothing more was at that time farther ſayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleander</hi> took his leave of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and they did not, as they had agreed, begin to ſpeak any more of them for ſome days after; that they might have time to read over, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what had been written, on both ſides, upon the ſubject of the Jeſuits Morals.</p>

               <head>The Second Diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CLeander</hi> being come to <hi>Eudoxus</hi>'s houſe, to begin their Diſcourſes touching the matter propos'd, found him in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, ſtill buſied in turning over ſeveral books, for and againſt the Jeſuits; wherein he had made a great many remarks, and layd them altogether upon his table. Ho then ſayd he coming in, what think you now of the Jeſuits polities, and the reflexions <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made upon this article? have you at laſt found the firſt part of Mr. <hi>Perrault's</hi> panegyric of the Provincial Letters true? <hi>Is there nothing but ſolidity in his reaſonings?</hi> for this is a point of reaſoning: and it is an effect of Mr. <hi>Paſcal's</hi> ſagacity, to have diſcover'd myſteries till then ſo cunningly conceal'd: it is alſo much for his honor, that he has open'd the eyes of the world, in a matter of ſo great importance.</p>
               <p>Several things, ſays <hi>Cleander,</hi> make me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this Syſtem: it is indeed a Syſtem, as you very well call it: the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he has there aſſerted, be ſolidly and ſtrongly prov'd and made out; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the bottom, it be nothing but a pure hypotheſis; which being propos'd in a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner, made the reader at firſt ſight ſay, that this might very well be: and which being continued, and always ſupported, by the ſame kind of artifice, do's ſo manage the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandng, that he is at laſt perſuaded, it is a moſt certain truth.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:174113:17"/>
               <p>This, in reality, is the main point of the difficulty, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and nothing cou'd be better ſtated. But let us look into the book: it is at the beginning of the fifth Letter, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> lays open the policy and myſteries of the Jeſuits: out of which <hi>Cleander</hi> read theſe words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>See here Sir what I promis'd you: theſe are the firſt draughts of the good Fathers, the Jeſuits Morals: of thoſe eminent men, for learning and wiſdom, who are all guided by the Spirit of God, which is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then all Philoſophy; perhaps you think I am in jeſt: but I ſpeak ſeriouſly, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is they themſelves that ſpeak in their book, intituled <hi>Imago primi ſaeculi;</hi> I do but copy their own words in this part of the encomium, as well as in that which follows. It is a ſociety of men, or rather of Angels, who were foretold by <hi>Iſaias</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Go forth you Angels light and nimble.</hi> Is not this a very clear prophecy of them? they are the Spirits of Eagles, a company of Phenixes, for an author has lately diſcover'd, that there are more birds of this kind, than one, at a time: they have chang'd the whole face of Chriſtianity: you muſt needs believe it, ſince they themſelves affirm it; and you will quickly perceive it, by the ſequel of this diſcourſe, which will inform you of their maxims. I was very deſirous to be fully inſtructed in them; and wou'd not truſt to what my friend had ſayd of them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:174113:17"/>but reſolv'd to ſee them with my own eyes, but I found he had told me nothing but truth: I believe he never tells a lye: you will ſee that by the account of our confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. In one that I had with him, he told me ſuch ſtrange things, that I cou'd hardly believe them; but he ſhew'd them in theſe Fathers own books: inſomuch that I had nothing to ſay in their defence, but that they were the opinions of ſome of their particular Divines, and therefore that it was unjuſt, to impute them to the whole body: and I aſſur'd him, I knew ſome of 'um, as ſevere, as thoſe he had quoted were looſe and remiſs. Hereupon he diſcover'd to me the Spirit of the Society, which is not known to all the world: and perhaps you will be very glad to underſtand it, which take in theſe his own words.</p>
                  <p>You think, ſayd he, to do them a great favor, by ſhewing that ſome of their Fathers, are, as conformable to the maxims of the Goſpel, as others, of them, are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and thence you will conclude, that the large opinions are not to be charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Society. I underſtand you very well, for if they were to be charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, they wou'd never have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, that any of their Society ſhou'd have publiſh'd ſo different opinions. But ſince they have alſo ſome among them, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain licentious doctrins, you ought likewiſe to conclude, that the doctrin of the whole
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:174113:18"/>Society is not that which is ſtrictly Chriſtian: for if that conſequence were to be made, they wou'd never have tolerated ſuch looſe opinions in any of their Fathers. And what, anſwer'd I, cou'd then be the deſign of the whole body? it is without doubt that they have no certain form'd deſign, and that every one has the liberty to ſay, at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, whatever he thinks upon any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. That cannot be, anſwer'd he: ſo great a body cou'd not ſubſiſt, by ſo raſh and inconſiderate a conduct; nor without a Soul, that directs and governs all it's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Beſides that, they have an order to print nothing, without the approbation of their Superiors. But how, ſayd I, can thoſe very Superiors conſent, to Maxims ſo very different? That is, reply'd he, what I wou'd have you underſtand. Know then, that their intention, is not, to corrupt mens manners; no, no, that is not their deſign: but neither it the reformation of them, their only aim: that wou'd be a piece of bad policy: but you may ſee what their thoughts are. They have ſo good an opinion of themſelves, as to believe, that it is both uſeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the good of Religion, that their credit ſhou'd reach every where, and that they ſhou'd govern all mens conſciences: and becauſe the Goſpel and ſevere Maxims are proper for ſome ſort of perſons, they make uſe of them, as oft as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. But becauſe theſe Maxims do not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:174113:18"/>agree with the deſign of the greateſt number of men, they lay them aſide, when they have to do with any of this laſt ſort; that they may have wherewithal to pleaſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all the world. For this reaſon, having to do with perſons of all ſorts; of different tempers, conditions, and countries, they judg'd it neceſſary, to have Caſuiſts ſuited to this great diverſity. From this principle, you'll eaſily judge, that if they had no others, but Caſuiſts of looſe Morals, they wou'd ruin their chief deſign; which is to get all the world into their own conduct and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe, that thoſe, who are truly pious and devout, wou'd endeavor to ſeek and find out a more certain way. But ſince there are but a few of this ſort, they do not need many ſevere Directors to guide them: they have a few ſevere ones, for the few devout; but a vaſt number of the looſe ones for the croud and multitude of thoſe that ſeek for relaxation.</p>
                  <p>It is by this obliging and accommoding conduct, as Father <hi>Petavius</hi> calls it, that they open their arms to all the world: for if any one comes to 'um, who is reſolv'd to reſtore his ill gotten goods, you need not fear that they will put him by. On the contrary, they will commend and confirm him in ſo holy a reſolution: but if another comes, that wou'd have abſolution without reſtitution; it will be hard, if they do not find means to do it, which they themſelves will warrant. By this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:174113:19"/>courſe they keep all their friends, and ſecure themſelves againſt their enemies: for if they be reproach'd, with the looſeneſs of their Morals, they immediatly produce their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere Directors, together with ſome books they have made of the rigor and ſeverity of the Chriſtian law: and the ſimple people, and ſuch as do not look into the bottom, the depth of things, are contented and put off with theſe kind of proofs.</p>
                  <p>Thus they are furniſh'd for all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and anſwer ſo well, according to what is demanded, that when they are in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where a Crucifi'd God paſſes for folly, they ſuppreſs the ſcandal of the Croſs, and preach Jeſus Chriſt a glorious, not a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Savior; as they have done in the <hi>Indies</hi> and in <hi>China;</hi> where, they have allow'd Chriſtians, even the practice of Idolatry, by the ſubtil invention of making them hide under their cloaths the Image of Jeſus Chriſt; to which they teach them to direct, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, the public adorations, which they make to the Idol <hi>Chacim-choan,</hi> and to their <hi>Keum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucum;</hi> as <hi>Gravina</hi> the Dominican objects againſt them, and as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Memorial preſented to <hi>Philip</hi> the IV King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Franciſcans of the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, reported by <hi>Thomas Hurvado</hi> in his book of Chriſtian Martyrs <hi>page</hi> 427, do's witneſs: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Congregation of Cardinals, <hi>De propaganda fide</hi> was oblig'd to forbid the Jeſuits, in particular, under pain of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:174113:19"/>not to ſuffer the adoration of Idols upon any pretext whatſoever; nor to hide the myſtery of the holy Croſs from thoſe they inſtructed in Religion: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, expreſly, not to Baptiſe any that were ignorant in this point; and injoyning them, to expoſe openly in their Churches the Image of the Crucifix; as is at large ſet down in the decree of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greation dated 9th. <hi>July</hi> 1646, ſign'd by Cardinal <hi>Caponi.</hi> You ſee now, how they have ſpread themſelves over all the earth, by the help of the doctrin of probable opinions, which is the ſpring and ground of all this irregularity and corruption.</p>
               </q>
               <p>It cannot but be acknowledg'd, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> crying out as ſoon as he had done reading, that all this is admirably well ſayd. Theſe little bits of <hi>Imago primi ſaeculi,</hi> are well brought in, and apply'd the beſt in the World: that plain ſhort ſtile he begins with; thoſe little jeſting reflexions, in two words, by way of parentheſis; <hi>Is it not a clear Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of them ....... I believe he never tells a ly;</hi> are, at once, both enlivening and diverting. In that natural plain way of relating a thing, that cunning artifice to prepare the readers mind, by finding ways to remove all obſtacles, which might hinder what one is about to ſay from being believ'd; there is not a word, that do's not anſwer his end, and ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm the Jeſuits before hand. This particular fact, of the Idolatry in <hi>China,</hi> mention'd as it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:174113:20"/>were but by accident, or by the by, and, without any ſeeming affectation, recounted in few words, but yet without omitting one ſingle circumſtance that might contribute to it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing believ'd as ſoon as ſpoken.</p>
               <p>It's no ſmall prejudice to the Jeſuits, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> interrupting him, that they do not own this thing, and that they pretend to have undeniably refus'd the impoſture. That's no matter, purſued <hi>Eudoxus:</hi> I find my ſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by this, almoſt in ſpite of me; and I am of opinion, that a great many others ought to be ſo too. But obſerve how <hi>Paſcal,</hi> in a few pages, has compris'd and prepar'd all that was neceſſary for his chief deſign; which is to make all the Jeſuits writers faults and miſtakes to light upon, and be imputed to the whole body: ſay what you pleaſe, this is a bit they cannot ſwallow or digeſt; this little piece, this particular inſtance, is not to be anſwer'd. As to the reſt, continues he, let that go for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For I ſee you ready, in your turn, to accuſe me of being prepoſſeſs'd in favor of <hi>Paſcal:</hi> all that I pretend to ſay, is, that he has given this paſſage a delicat turn; expreſs'd it ſo very finely, that nothing cou'd be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive, or at leaſt more ſeducing.</p>
               <p>Whatever you wou'd ſay of it, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> I ſee plainly, that the Jeſuits are not very ſafe in your hands: and that without any great force upon your ſelf, you cou'd ſtand up ſtifly in defence of what I have juſt now read to you, in caſe you ſhou'd not ſee it fully and perfectly refuted.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:174113:20"/>
               <p>Not ſo faſt, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> do not I pray diſtruſt my equity. I have newly vow'd, to be indifferent and ſtand neuter, between both parties, and nothing is able ſo to dazzle me, as to make me miſtake the truth. 'Tis with the ſame diſpoſition of mind, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that I am reſolv'd to tell you, plainly, and without exaggeration, what may be ſayd in favor of the Society.</p>
               <p>The end and policy of the Jeſuits, ſayd he, <hi>is, to make themſelves Maſters of all mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; now there are two ſorts of Chriſtians; ſome that are truly pious, who ſeek for a ſure way; for whom the Jeſuits have taken care to have ſome ſevere Caſuiſts; but a few for the few; whereas they have a multitude of looſe Caſuiſts, who preſent themſelves to the multitude of thoſe that ſeek for liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxatien.</hi> Then he adds: <hi>See how they have ſpread themſelves over all the earth, by the favor and aſſiſtance of the doctrin of probability, which is the ſource and baſis of all this irregularity and corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You might have added the direction of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the doctrin of equivocations: for theſe alſo, as <hi>Paſcal</hi> tells us, are main points of the Jeſuits Morals.</p>
               <p>That's true, reply'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> but theſe points, as great and general as they are, may be look'd upon, but as particular points, which we may examin at leiſure: and it ſeems to me, that, for the preſent, we ought to dive and ſift into nothing but their politics: the wonderful intelligence they have among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:174113:21"/>for one and the ſame end; and which makes them, by concert and contrivance, act, ſo effectually, for the glory and grandeur of their Society: and the admirable partition of the rigorous and the relax'd doctrin between their Doctors; of whom, ſome are enjoyn'd to make the beſt of the firſt, and others of the ſecond: all aiming, thô by ſo contrary means, <hi>By the favor and aſſiſtance of the doctrin of probable opinions,</hi> at one and the ſame end. To have diſcover'd this, if you believe <hi>Paſcal, Is, to have found out the Spirit of the Society, which is not known to all the world.</hi> This is, in reality, the moſt curious part of this whole affair: and if the diſcovery of the partition be real and not chimerical, if this particular, ſingle point, be very certain, all that he afterwards ſays of the Jeſuits, may very well be believ'd. I ſhoul'd be no longer ſhock'd or offended at <hi>Wendrock's</hi> invectives againſt theſe Fathers, nor at the horrible injuries, wherewith he treats and oppreſſes them. But I declare to you, that I cannot eaſily conceive, nor ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſuch a project cou'd have been form'd, or carry'd on ſo long; that is to ſay till <hi>Paſcal's</hi> time, or at leaſt till the birth, or ſpringing up of Janſeniſme, without any body's perceiving it; or that, during all the wars and diſputes the Proteſtants have had with the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and wherein the Jeſuits were always the firſt aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not one of their obſtinat enemies, ſhou'd have thought of attaching them on that ſide:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:174113:21"/>and that a thouſand men ſhou'd have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, induſtriouſly, to examin, to meditate, to criticize upon, to decry their inſtitute, to ſtudy their conduct, and to ſearch into the ſecrets of their pretended politics, and yet not to make this diſcovery, is a thing, which, really appears to me, incredible, and morally impoſſible.</p>
               <p>For, let us reaſon and argue a little, and ſound, if it be poſſible, into the depth of this policy. By what perſon, I pray you, cou'd this ſtrange deſign be conceiv'd and brought forth? was it by their founder Saint <hi>Ignatius?</hi> can we ſee, I do not ſay the ſcheme, but the ſhadow or leaſt idea of it in their Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? do any of the decrees of their General Congregations carry a tendency to this end? can we point at any one of their Generals, from Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> downwards, to this day that has plotted this conſpiracy, ſo fatal to the Goſpel, and the purity of our Savior's Morals? was it not think you Father <hi>Caraffa,</hi> he, who without diſpute was one of the holieſt men of our age, and who, after he had govern'd for ſome years, died, but juſt as <hi>Paſcal</hi> had attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſo good and laudable an intention to the Society? for, infine to carry on a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fix't and determin'd after this manner, and ſuch as <hi>Paſcal</hi> propoſes it, the execution of which depends upon the whole body, or, at leaſt, upon a great number of particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who muſt have the ſame proſpects and deſigns, there muſt be one conductor and one
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:174113:22"/>ſoul, with whom all theſe ſeveral particulars muſt have a correſpondence, to guide and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the motion. When <hi>Titus Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> ſome years ſince, made a ſcheme of a plot in <hi>England,</hi> which coſt Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and the five Jeſuits their lives, they did not forget a ſeeming probability and ſhew of truth. They made the General of the Jeſuits, by the Pope's permiſſion, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all Commiſſions for the war, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all Offices of the Crown. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſwore, they had ſeen a patent ſealed with the Societies ſeal, by which my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> was conſtituted Lord high Chancellor of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by another, my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> was made Lord high Treaſurer; by a third, my Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> was declar'd General of the Army, that was to be raiſed againſt the King: of this army, my Lord <hi>Petre</hi> was appointed Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, all ſign'd by <hi>Joannes Paulus Oliva General of the Jeſuits.</hi> In this manner things were particularly reſolv'd upon and ſpecified: the pretended head of the plot, and all the other conſpirators, were very well known; and all this was believ'd by the common people of <hi>England,</hi> and God knows what horrid things were then ſayd of the Jeſuits politics. I wou'd fain ſee ſomething like that, in this other conſpiracy, of which the Jeſuits are accus'd; eſpecially, ſince <hi>Paſcal</hi> gives us to underſtand, as he do's in the fifth Provincial Letter, that this great abuſe, and total ſubverſion of our Saviors Morals, is, not the effect of hazard,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:174113:22"/>nor of an extravagant fancy, but, a ſetled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed matter; which althô it be not the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits end, their principal end, it is, however, a mean agreed and reſolv'd upon among them, and of which without any new deliberation they daily make uſe, every one in his way, to bring about their main purpoſe and deſign.</p>
               <p>It is pleaſantly done of you, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him, to compare Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> with <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe;</hi> thoſe two gallant fellows, whoſe equally groſs and infamous proceedings had ſo incens'd Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tom. 1. pag. 292.</note> that in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Catholics, he cou'd not forbear calling them <hi>rogues</hi> and <hi>villains.</hi> As to the reſt, I do not very well know, what anſwer Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> wou'd have made you, if the queſtion had been put to himſelf: but I know, that in the place we have newly read, he ſeems to have obviated the objection, and anſwer'd it before hand. For being deſirous to eſtabliſh that principle, which makes ſo great a part of all his Letters, that this contrariety of ſevere and remiſs Caſuiſts, which is to be ſeen, as he ſays, in the Society, was not the effect of chance, nor of a liberty, that every one in it might have, of following his own caprice or wild fancy, in the choice of his opinions, this is the manner he ſpeaks in.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ho what cou'd there be, anſwer'd I him, the deſign of the whole body? it muſt needs be, that they have no certain fix't and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate deſign, and that every one has the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſay, at all adventures, whatever he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:174113:23"/>thinks fit. That cannot be, reply'd he; ſo great a body cou'd not ſubſiſt with a raſh, inconſiderat, conduct, or without a ſoul, that rul'd and govern'd all it's motions. Beſides they have a particular order, not to print any thing, without leave from their Superiors. But how then, ſayd I to him, can the Superiors conſent to Maxims ſo very contrary? that is the thing I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you wirh, anſwer'd he. Know then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is again repeated in the ninth Letter, as a point of the laſt importance. <q>And do you not know, ſays his Jeſuit, that our Society is anſwerable for all the books of our Fathers? I muſt needs inſtruct you in this matter, for it is very fit you ſhou'd know it: there is an order in our Society, by which all ſorts of Printers and Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers are forbid to ſell any of our Fathers works without the approbation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and the permiſſion of the Superiors of our Society .......... Inſomuch, that our whole body is reſponſable, for all the books of every one of our Fathers: whence it comes to paſs, that no work of ours, which has not the ſpirit of the Society is ever pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, and thus have I told you, in few words, what I judg'd was convenient for you to know.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this you ſee, continu'd <hi>Eudoxus, Paſcal</hi> ſuppoſes, that this policy reſides in the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors of the Society; and that it is, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:174113:23"/>and agreement with them, that the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors do act, in bringing about this deſign of the whole body; and he do's not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but alſo farther endeavors to prove it, by obſerving and ſetting down, what is very true, that they have a particular order to print nothing without their Superiors permiſſion.</p>
               <p>It is of theſe cunning words, reply'd <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> you wou'd now diſcourſe, words, which are thrown in, as it were by the by, without any ſeeming affectation, and which yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding make the deepeſt impreſſion upon the readers mind. Upon the coming forth of the Jeſuits Apologies, they never fail'd to make a great noiſe of this their rule, to print nothing without the General's conſent. But this week, as I was looking over all theſe matters, I was very deſirous to ſatisfie my ſelf in this point, as well as in the others. To which end I went ere yeſterday to viſit a Jeſuit of my acquaintance, a man of wit and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and put him upon this ſubject. I told him, that this particular order, known to be among their rules, of printing nothing without their Generals leave, was, by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, made uſe of to their prejudice, and, by vertue of it, all the faults of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were attributed to the whole body.</p>
               <p>I ſee then, ſayd he to me, that you alſo have been ſo good and eaſy, as to ſuffer your ſelf to be trapand, drawn in and caught in this net, as before you, ſeveral others have been. You call this a particular order, as if it were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:174113:24"/>not common to us, with almoſt all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and bodys of men where there is any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and ſubordination; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is but againſt us only, that it is objected and improv'd. But the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, adds he, of executing this order, will convince you, of the weakneſs of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our enemies draw from this topic: it is true, that we have this rule or order, to print nothing without our Generals permiſſion, but it is not to be ſuppos'd, that the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reads and paſſes his own judgment upon all the books printed by the Jeſuits in every part of the world. If that were ſo, his whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs wou'd only be to read books: for there has been a General, under whoſe government there were volumes enuff made, upon the ſingle controverſies with the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany, Flanders, France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to have taken up and employ'd the whole time of his General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But for your farther ſatisfaction, you are to know, that the ordinary method of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencing books is after this manner.</p>
               <p>The General gives the Provincials power, to approve of all the books in their own diſtricts. But you muſt not fancy, that the Provincials themſelves do read theſe books; no, no, their other employments do not allow them leiſure for ſuch a work: but they name three perſons to do it, upon whoſe ſuffrages, they either give or refuſe their approbation, and theſe three perſons in paſſing their judgments are oblig'd to follow, not their own particular
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:174113:24"/>notions and prejudices, but (eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Divinity) the opinions commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Catholic Schools and Univerſities. This is uſually the rule they follow, wherein a great many other very good ones are includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is the way ordinarily taken for this buſineſs, and it is impoſſible it ſhou'd be done otherwiſe. So that you ſee, there is little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a book printed, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of three Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> with reference to the whole houſe of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and a book printed, upon the approbation of three Jeſuit Divines, with reference to the whole Society of Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>After the Father had thus entertain'd me upon this ſubject, he put me in mind of the perſecutions, rais'd againſt the Society in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Coton's</hi> time, and the beginning of their eſtabliſhment in <hi>France;</hi> occaſion'd by books, brought from <hi>Italy</hi> and other places, to make the <hi>French</hi> Jeſuits guilty of treaſon againſt the ſtate, or to be look'd upon as enemies to the liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and how the Court and Parlament, in thoſe days, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their prejudice, and the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were continually ſuggeſted againſt them, did always, in that affair, hearken to, and perfectly govern themſelves, by reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now the matter being thus, continu'd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and in reality not being poſſible to be otherwiſe, do's it not appear to you, that the ſyſtem of the Jeſuits politics, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has built upon this weak and ruinous foundation,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174113:25"/>is falſe and malicious? and this being allow'd, wou'd not the compariſon I made, without pretending that it was very exact, be a little more ſo, than you thought of firſt? what a pleaſant argument is this? the Provincial of a Province in <hi>Spain</hi> approves a book, upon the ſuffrages, or votes of three <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the Society; this book then being approv'd by the Superior, contains or comprehends the ſpirit of the whole ſociety. Now the Jeſuits having ſeveral different opinions, in their books, about one and the ſame matter, this diverſity among their Divines, which is every day to be found, muſt be an effect of the General's politics, who preſides over all, and who takes care for the glory and benefit of the Society, to make and keep up this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinions, at no leſs a price to the Church, than the ſubverſion of Chriſtianity, and the deſtruction of the Goſpel: theſe are things, which a man, upon the leaſt reflexion, wou'd be aſham'd to have once thought, or but even ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eudoxus</hi> ſatisfied with this account of <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> ſayd to him: you have indeed hit the nail on the head, and this ſimple explanation you have made of the matter, diſcovers, by it ſelf alone, the weakneſs, the eſſential weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all <hi>Paſcals</hi> Letters. But however, do not value your ſelf too much, upon the honor of this my confeſſion: for I my ſelf, for a long time, have had ſome ſcrupules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this fine ſyſtem, in ſpite of the dazzling
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:174113:25"/>manner it is propos'd in: he includes, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes certain paradoxes, which are highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, and too remote from the common ordinary notions and ideas: for, according to what <hi>Paſcal</hi> pretends to teach us of the Jeſuits government, all thoſe, who have had any ſhare in it, muſt needs have been, and ſtill are, not only great politicians (a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I my ſelf know for certain, ſeveral of 'um do not deſerve) but alſo moſt wicked profligate wretches, and the moſt reſolv'd, and incorrigible libertins, who had abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd all piety, and Religion. But let me yet ask you, once more, what, according to <hi>Paſcal,</hi> is the matter in diſpute? nothing leſs, than the overturning and confounding the whole Goſpel, the introducing Morals, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly carnal, inſtead of thoſe taught us by our Savior, the profaning our greateſt and moſt auguſt myſteries; and that in cold blood, by previous agreement and methods, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures expreſly reſolv'd on, marking out, to every man, the part he was to act in this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable conſpiracy; wherein, ſome were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear harſh and ſevere; others, gentle and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoding. So that, not only the Superiors, but all their Divines, all their Confeſſors, all their Directors muſt engage in ſo damnable a plot; that is to ſay, two thirds of this great body: for, excepting the yong men, who are not in holy orders, all, or almoſt all, ſome, more, ſome, leſs, are employ'd in conducting and guiding of Souls. Now, to come to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:174113:26"/>matter of fact, I am very confident, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, nor I, nor any perſon in <hi>Paris,</hi> nor in any other parts of <hi>France,</hi> nor even thoſe they call Janſeniſts, will ever believe, that any Jeſuit, of their acquaintance, is capable of ſuch and exceſs of impiety. I never yet ſaw the man, that ſayd to me, of any one of them in particular: I know this Jeſuit, to be a libertin, an Atheiſt, a man without conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and one, that wou'd ſell his Soul, for the glory and intereſt of his Society: on the contrary, they give them, in general, the honor of certain vertu's, which can, as little, ſubſiſt without faith and the fear of God, as faith and the fear of God can, with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of this damnable policy. The Janſeniſts, from time to time, do make ſome common places in their books, in favor of their own patty, which ſometimes the Jeſuits, finding them made to their hands, may, I hope, be allow'd to apply to their own uſe. As for example, that which is ſayd in a little book call'd <hi>Le Pere</hi> Bouhours <hi>convaincu de calomnie,</hi> and which may ſerve for a handſome pithy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to all I have ſayd on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He muſt be very corrupt himſelf and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at heart, in the words of that author, who imagin'd his neighbor cou'd be guilty of ſuch deſperat wickedneſs and corruption; and none, but a man extreamly fond of the eſteem of the world, cou'd fancy that others, by a form'd deſign, wou'd be willing to buy, at the price of their faith and of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:174113:26"/>a vain name and reputation; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mad fooliſh pleaſure of being talk'd of, no matter whether for good, or for evil.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will not examin, continued <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the truth of this reflexion, but ſuppoſing it very probable, in reference to any one particular; it ought to appear much more ſo, in reference to the Superiors, Confeſſors, Directors and Miſſioners of the whole Society taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together; and it wou'd be in my opinion, a leſs wonder, to ſee, among the Janſeniſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, one or two hypocrites, libertins in their hearts, than to ſee this great number of Jeſuits, without God, without faith and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>But what do I ſay, their Superiors, their Directors, their Miſſioners? After <hi>Paſcal</hi> had unvail'd and diſcover'd all theſe pretended my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and that the Provincial Letters had been read by all the Jeſuits; after that, by vertue of theſe Letters, ſo many people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd they had a right to accuſe them of their looſe Morals; wou'd none of all thoſe yong Jeſuits, from whom till then they had hid the ſecret of their order, and who for the moſt part do not want wit, have open'd their eyes, and abhor'd to continue members of ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted a body? what deſertion ought we not to have ſeen, by the favor of a motive ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſo reaſonable as that? for it is not the ſame thing in this, as in other orders: here is always a door open, or at leaſt one
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:174113:27"/>that is eaſily open'd to thoſe who are fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to be gone. What fairer pretence cou'd any ſuch have had, to color their baſeneſs, or their inconſtancy? and as for ſuch, as are ſometimes turn'd out of the Society, for their misbehaviour and ill conduct, cou'd they have had a more ſure, and a more eaſy way to be reveng'd, than to publiſh and reveal this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery? or have the Superiors of the Society, over and above their politics, the art to infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuat and bewitch men, or, at one bout, to make ſo great a number of perſons, Atheiſts, that have enter'd into their order, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to ſecure themſelves, againſt the corruption of the world? now from what I have already ſayd, it is clear, this policy of the Jeſuits, cou'd be no longer a myſtery, to any of themſelves; and not being a myſtery, it wou'd be a miracle, without example, if none among them ſhou'd have been ſcandaliz'd at, and afterwards diſcover'd this ſo abominable and ſo horrid an impiety.</p>
               <p>It wou'd be yet a much greater prodigy, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> to ſee men of ſuch colors or characters, as the Jeſuits are ſometimes pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, ſtrive for, and unanimouſly tend to the glory of their Society, by ways ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ſo unequal, as are the employments of this Society. Some are ſeen in Courts, in credit and in reputation, reſpected, applauded, and honored with the kindneſs and confidence of Princes; whilſt, at the ſame time, a very great number dy, of cold and hunger, in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:174113:27"/>foreſts of <hi>Canada:</hi> others go, with all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy and chearfulneſs, to ruin their healths for the remainder of their lives, in the Iſles of ſouth, <hi>America;</hi> where of thirty, there are not found two, that in time are not deſtroy'd by the very malignity of the air; not to ſpeak of thoſe, that have been hang'd in <hi>England,</hi> burnt or buried alive in <hi>Japan,</hi> the common fate of a great number of their Miſſioners. For you muſt underſtand,
<note place="margin">Morale pratique pref. du a. tom.</note> that it is plainly ſayd, and publicly printed, that the Jeſuits, in thoſe Countries, are not one jot better, than thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> And let them ſay as much as they pleaſe, of their trading and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching themſelves in thoſe far diſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, it is putting too great a value upon traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick and commerce; and I know none, how greedy ſoever of gain, that wou'd be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants upon ſuch terms. Theſe good Fathers then will go, with great content and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to have themſelves roaſted and eaten alive, by the <hi>Iroques</hi> and wild <hi>Americans,</hi> and to paſs the winters, in the woods, with ſavages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other places of retreat, than a poor hut, or a cabane made of the bark of trees, where the ſmoak blinds and choaks thoſe that are forc'd to retire thither, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the extremity and bitterneſs of the cold; and all this, forſooth, only to have the honor of eſtabliſhing, over all the world, their looſe Morals, and enlarging the glory of their Society; and to give to the Secular Preachers, ſometimes invited to Preach upon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:174113:28"/>Saint <hi>Ignatius's</hi> day, an occaſion to compliment the Jeſuits of <hi>Paris,</hi> for their zeal, their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and their Apoſtolic labors. If this be ſo, I do not deſpair, but that we may live to ſee, ſome time or other, a Society of high-way men ſpring up, who, all joyning together in the deſign of robbing, plundering and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will agree among themſelves, that ſome, of them, ſhall peacably enjoy their booties, and the fruits of the others labors, without ever expoſing themſelves to any danger; and that theſe, after they have ſufficiently robb'd and plunder'd, without enjoying any profit or advantage by all their labors, will give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to be hang'd and broken alive upon wheeles, only for the intereſt, and the ſecurity of the reſt of their companions.</p>
               <p>Self-love, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> is, in truth, too much ſelf-love, to devote it ſelf ſo abſolutely and ſo intirely to the public good; ſuch a kind of Man, is, in Morals, a chimerical whimſey, and it were meer madneſs to think, there cou'd be found a man, who, out of zeal to the common intereſt, wou'd wholy forget or deny himſelf, and ſacrifice his eaſe and quiet, his pleaſures, his ſatisfaction and his life, to the glory of the body, whereof he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without once thinking of his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

               <p>That wou'd be, without doubt, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> a very refin'd piece of vanity, and an act of pride, of a very particular nature: it is very rare to ſee, but two men of the ſame rank and quality, the ſame age, and, as near as poſſible, of equal wit and merit, agree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling out, or without hurting or injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another upon occaſion, if they be but never ſo little touch'd with vain-glory, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with the ſpirit of pride: and yet one may ſee thouſands of men, the vaineſt that ever were, if you'll believe the author of the ſyſtem we are examining; of which the greateſt part have wit and learning, and who, naturally ſpeaking, ought to rival one another in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; I ſay, one may ſee them, accept of, and do their duty without murmuring, in poſts that are moſt extreamly unequal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which there is as much difference, for the conveniences of life, for diet and for lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for converſation, for employment, and for all the natural ſatisfactions of the mind, as there is between the faireſt and greateſt Citys of this Kingdom, and the wildeſt and moſt dreadful Deſarts of <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Monomotapa.</hi> Certainly, if this be the effect, either of vanity, or of policy, one may very well call it, a moſt extraordinary and incomparable Maſter-piece. So that whatever the author of the <hi>Paralelle des Anciens &amp; des Modernes</hi> thinks of it, I will
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:174113:29"/>deduct, out of the panegyric he has made o the Provincial Letters, his <hi>Solidity of reaſoning, or arguing,</hi> at leaſt upon this firſt and moſt principal article. I can, in this point, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare at beſt <hi>Paſcal's</hi> cunning but to the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of skilful painters in perſpective, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and expoſe pieces, which, at firſt view, pleaſantly deceive and inveigle the lookers on, to make raſh and falſe judgments; but ſuch indeed, as are eaſily and ſoon corrected, by reaſon and reflexion. Nothing, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> can be better, more full, and more expreſſive than this your compariſon.</p>
               <p>I have ſomething yet to ſay, anſwer'd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> of greater force, and much more to the purpoſe; and which comes ſo naturally into a man's mind, who reads the Provincial Letters with never ſo little attention, and without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, that, certainly, it cou'd not have eſcap'd your own thoughts and reflexion. <hi>Paſcal</hi> do's not at all keep his word with us. He undertakes to give us the character of a policy particular to the Jeſuits, as the moſt ſubtil and crafty, that ever was invented or contriv'd by the wit of man: he promiſes to make us ſee into it's inmoſt receſſes, and find out the fineſt and moſt delicat parts of this myſtery; but how, I pray, do's he go about it? no doubt one wou'd think very learnedly and profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but alas! after all, he makes the Jeſuits chooſe, very wiſely, means to arrive at their ends, which, generally ſpeaking, are common to theirs, with all other orders; with all other
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:174113:29"/>communities, and with all Univerſities: and by conſequence either do not prove, that theſe Fathers are more ſubtil than others, or elſe, that others are, full as cunning as they.</p>
               <p>And to make plauſible this diverſity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, of which ſome are eaſy and compleſant, others rigorous and ſevere, he has made the Jeſuits the inventors of the doctrin of probable opinions in Divinity; by which, ſays he, the contrariety of deciſions is not only permitted, but alſo made uſeful and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>That is not an ill thought, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and this diverſity of Directors, of whom ſome determin ſeverely, others looſely, ſeems very like truth, and probable enuff according to the doctrin of probabilities, by which, very often ſome do, in reality, decide the caſes propos'd, in a contrary manner to what others do.</p>
               <p>That is true, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander;</hi> but as ill luck wou'd have it for <hi>Paſcal,</hi> it is too well known, that this doctrin is much older than the Jeſuits: and that it is ſo far, from being peculiar to them, that before it was decried and run down, by the horrible, friteful figures, wherein it was repreſented, that is to ſay, till within theſe thirty or forty years, it was taught every where, in all the Schools of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Inſomuch, that the Jeſuits,

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:174113:30"/>thoſe of <hi>Louvain,</hi> of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans,</hi> and of all others; maintaining, and, in my opinion fully proving, that they never taught any thing in this matter, but what was taught, by the chief, and almoſt all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of theſe ſeveral Schools and Univerſities. I will ſhew you this book, whenever you will: for the proof of this matter of fact, which is moſt certainly true, wou'd carry us too far away from our preſent buſineſs. In the mean time, give me leave, to make this concluſion: that, if the doctrin of probable opinions, be, the ſecret and eſſential point of the Jeſuits po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics, the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins,</hi> the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> the Univerſity of <hi>Louvain</hi> and all others, are to the full, at leaſt, as knowing as they, in matters of policy: and that, on one ſide, they do the Jeſuits too much honor, in giving them more wit and more learning, than to all theſe famous Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and on the other, the greateſt injuſtice in the world, by making them, under this pretence, the ſole authors of the real or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended corruption of Chriſtian Morals.</p>
               <p>To which I will add; that you ſhall not only find, in all theſe ſeveral bodies, this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful foundation of the Jeſuits policy, I mean the doctrin of probable opinions, together with all that depends upon it; but I will alſo ſhew you, and, in the ſame way, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made uſe of, with ſo much wit, and ſo much charity to the Jeſuits, that among the Divines of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> and of <hi>Louvain,</hi> among the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:174113:30"/>
                  <hi>Dominicans</hi> and other Religious orders, the two ſorts of Directors, he mentions, the ſevere and the eaſy ones, are, without controverſy, to be found; and by ſubſtituting the names of theſe communities, inſtead of the Jeſuits, I will prepare you, by the fifth Provincial Letter, to hear their panegyric, exactly like or equal to that, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made for the Society. I may perhaps retrench out of it, the ſtory of <hi>John d'Alba,</hi> that of the probable box on the ear at <hi>Compiegne,</hi> ſome ſtroakes and touches of <hi>Imago primi ſaeculi:</hi> but ſearching on a little farther, I ſhall not miſs of enuff and to ſpare, to make amends for this retrenchment. And I ſhall find very near as much to divert my ſelf upon this ſubject, as <hi>Paſcal</hi> has done. I will make my ſelf the ſame ſport, and with the ſame ſeries of collections, out of ſeveral au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, heap'd up together, and diſpos'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my own fancy; I will draw the ſame conſequencies, make the ſame compariſons, the ſame invectives, and the ſame applications; and I will end with an addreſs to the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or to others as <hi>Paſcal</hi> has finiſh'd his thirteenth Letter with one to the Jeſuits, in theſe words. <q>Let us then conclude, my Fathers, that ſince your probability makes the good opinions of ſome of your authors unuſeful to the Church, and only uſeful to your politics, they ſerve but to ſhew, by their contrariety, your double heartedneſs, the inſincerity of your dealings, which you have plainly diſcover'd by declaring to us, that you have ſome of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:174113:31"/>your Divines, on one ſide againſt murder, and that, on the other, you have many more eminent Caſuiſts for it: to the end you may have two ways to offer men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying thereby the ſimplicity of the ſpirit of God, who curſes all double minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who provide for themſelves two paths to walk in, <hi>Ve duplici corde, &amp; ingredienti dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vijs.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Jeſuits, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> have long ſince in their Apologies made this obſervation, which effectually and irrefragably proves, if it be true, what you intended to make out, that <hi>Paſcal's</hi> way of arguing in this matter is not <hi>ſolid,</hi> taking the word <hi>ſolid</hi> in it's common ordinary notion and acceptation. But it ſeems the author of the paralelle has form'd of it to himſelf a notion of much greater extent or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Perhaps as a member of the Academy he may have, or pretend to have, a right over the ſignification of words. How weak ſoever the arguments we treat of may be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the wit which made uſe of them has given them ſome ſtrength. Is it not to think and in ſome manner to write ſolidly, to get directly to his end, and to know how to guide and conduct his readers to it; to engage them in his intereſts, to inſpire them with what thoughts he pleaſes, and to make them ſay their author is in the right, and that his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are for certain in the wrong? has not <hi>Paſcal</hi> got what he aim'd at; and obtain'd his deſign? he has made his book to be read by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174113:31"/>all the world, and be believ'd by many; he has made, almoſt, every thing he has ſayd in this matter plauſible and currant. Exact truth was not the rule he follow'd; at leaſt in the point we now ſpeak of. Chriſtian charity, a word much made uſe of in the <hi>Port-Royal</hi> books, has a little ſuffer'd by it, and nothing can be plainer, than that in this he has not acted by the ſtrict laws of ſevere Morals. But it has produc'd at leaſt the effect he intended: for my part, I'le call this being <hi>ſolid,</hi> if it were but to pleaſure or compliment Mr. <hi>Perrault.</hi> But to come to the point, the bottom of the matter, continues he, do you think that <hi>Paſcal</hi> was in earneſt, and had a mind to be believ'd in all he ſayd? ſurely his only thoughts were to gratiſy his friends, and gain himſelf a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: this it was without doubt which made him ſo very deſirous to divert both himſelf and the public.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> interrupting him, you do not fully conſider what <hi>Paſcal</hi> had in proſpect: ſee what <hi>Wendrok</hi> ſays of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he open'd and read him the latter part of his firſt note upon the eleventh Letter, wherein he ſpeaks after this manner. <q>To believe that <hi>Montaltius</hi> had no deſign in theſe Letters, but merriment and ſport, or to make men laugh at the Jeſuits coſt, and divert the world by his witty writings, is to make an unjuſt and falſe judgment of them. He propos'd to himſelf a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and a more holy end, and aim'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

               </p>
               <p>Ay marry Sir, this is fine, good indeed, and very likely, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> laughing, as if I did not know <hi>Wendrok</hi> and his friends, and underſtand their meaning; 'twas, no doubt, for the good and benefit of the Jeſuits, and in meer charity to 'um, that they writ the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters, and ſent them about to every body; that they firſt preſented them to their Proſelits for a fifth Goſpel; and that ſince, within theſe two years, their friends, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of **** order'd them to be read in the Penſioners Refectory; that they publiſh'd ſix or ſeven tomes of their practical Morals; and that in the Seminary of the Dioceſe of **** this book was formerly recommended, to ſuch as were to enter into holy Orders, for their Spiritual Lectures; that they got all ſorts of libels againſt the Society to be ſent from <hi>Japan</hi> and from <hi>China,</hi> from the <hi>Philipine</hi> Iſlands, and from <hi>Paraquay;</hi> that they made <hi>the Jeſuits Theater</hi> the maddeſt, and as is ſayd, the moſt extravigantly ſlanderous piece, that ever was ſeen, paſs under the name, and for the work, of a moſt holy and illuſtrious Spaniſh Biſhop; and that they ſtill daily give themſelves, upon every occaſion, a looſe againſt theſe Fathers, endeavoring any how to deſtroy and ſubvert their reputations; railing and inveighing bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt them, in their books, and in all companys, and converſations. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his enumeration to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of the effects
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:174113:32"/>of Charity, has forgot to make mention of any of theſe kinds; which makes me often doubt, whether Janſeniſt Charity be of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or kind, with Chriſtian Charity. And to ſpeak my thoughts freely, I never ſaw any thing more od, not to ſay more ſacrilegious, than the union they make of the charity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, with that gall, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and animoſity, which, on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſhew and expreſs; and which they endeavor to inſpire into all mankind, both in privat and in public. I do aſſure you, that this very reflexion, alone, wou'd have hinder'd me from cloſing with this party, from being drawn in, dup'd, or made one of their cully's: and I am ſurpris'd to think, how men of wit cou'd hope, or expect, long, to blind or daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the world by this method. For, tho' it be mightily corrupted, it has yet judgment enuff left, to diſcern and diſtinguiſh, whether ſome things proceed from the ſpirit of God, or from malice and paſſion.</p>
               <p>And as for me, adds <hi>Cleander,</hi> I never ſaw this admirable ſecret, of ſanctifying the moſt grievous injuries and invectives, practis'd, on a hundred occaſions, by Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> and his friends, without being mov'd to laughter. I am perſuaded if <hi>Moliére</hi> had but brought a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tartuffe upon the ſtage, he wou'd have given him this character; and, thereby have diverted the ſpectators as much as by the firſt. But I plainly perceive, continu'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that we are fully agreed about the idea we have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:174113:33"/>form'd to our ſelves, of the ſcheme <hi>Paſcal</hi> has drawn of the Jeſuits politics. You pardon <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault</hi> his having call'd it <hi>ſolid,</hi> ſince the author has obtain'd his end, and that he had the skill, according to the deſign he had fram'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to make all he ſayd paſs for, or, at leaſt, appear, like truth; and at the ſame time to give the reader ſo much pleaſure and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to hinder him from reflecting upon the weakneſs and vanity of his ſyſtem: this I wou'd have you paſs by and allow me.</p>
               <p>You will alſo grant me, that looking nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into things, this policy, ſo particular, ſo myſterious, and, at the ſame time, ſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, is a meer empty fantome; which, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the fine and advantagious cloths he had dreſs'd it in, has nothing in it even of probability; nor can have any, except in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or in <hi>Holland,</hi> where a Jeſuit and a wizard or a conjurer paſſes, among the generality, for one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Your thoughts and mine, anſwers <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> do perfectly agree: but this being ſuppos'd, cannot we now make, at leaſt, upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular article, the ſame reflexions that the Marchioneſſe of <hi>Sablé</hi> did, of which you ſpoke in our former converſation; and ask, with what conſcience <hi>Paſcal</hi> cou'd divert himſelf and the world, by a notion or idea, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever empty and groundleſs it appears, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, to any one, that gives himſelf but a little trouble to examin it, leaves notwithſtanding a moſt frightful impreſſion on the minds of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:174113:33"/>greateſt part of his readers? by what principle of charity, or honeſty, has he endevor'd, in the following Letters, to fortify and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then this impreſſion, till he has given this idea root and footing, and made it familiar to all people; and, afterwards taking it for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable truth, he has made uſe of it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him, to tear in pieces moſt unmercifully the reputation of ſo conſiderable a body, as that of the Jeſuits: for, as you very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a little while ago, <hi>Paſcals</hi> pleaſanteries got more ground and credit, than ſeveral at firſt thought they ever cou'd or did deſerve. From this hypotheſis or ſuppoſition of the Jeſuits Plot to aggrandize their Society, he claims a right, to ſay whatever he pleaſes; and makes them ſacrifice all things even to the very Goſpel, to bring it about he makes uſe of it, to have this Society look'd upon, as the plague of the Church, and to make every thing they either ſay or do be ſuſpected. Upon this principle a caſe is ill decided by a Divine of this Society, muſt not be allow'd, as in another man, to be an effect of human weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but a wilful crime, and a premeditated attempt againſt the doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt. They may pretend, but all in vain, that twenty of the moſt eminent Divines of the Society were of a contrary opinion; that was order'd, and done on purpoſe, for no other end, but to eſtabliſh his ſyſtem, of the diviſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors into two ſorts, the one rigid and ſevere, the others ſoft and compleſant. Whatever
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:174113:34"/>courſe the Jeſuits take to defend themſelves, <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſtill renews his attacks againſt them, and reinforces all by this common place.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, adds <hi>Cleander,</hi> that this falſe ſyſtem, which is taken for granted in all the Provincial Letters, and from whence all that is beſides contain'd in them, derives it's force, is a moſt horrible calumny, and an impoſture carried on, and continued from one end to the other.</p>
               <p>Why did not the Jeſuits, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> make this be perceiv'd, when thoſe Letters were firſt publiſh'd? this fooliſh notion, which upon the firſt ſerious reflexion falls to the ground, having been once remov'd, all the world after a fit of laughter wou'd have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd no thoughts, but of indignation againſt this Champion of ſevere Morals, and againſt thoſe that had relax'd them, perceiving plainly that their actions were quite contrary to the maxims which they preach'd. Before the Jeſuit went about to convince him, as they under took to do, of his nine and twenty particular falſhoods and impoſtures, they ought to have begun with this general and eſſential impoſture. And this being once prov'd, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more eaſy, all the world wou'd have been prepar'd to receive the reſt as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: it wou'd have ruin'd beforehand the whole ſtrength of <hi>Paſcals</hi> replyes, all which turn upon this hinge, as well as his firſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. The Jeſuits not having ſoon enuff chas'd away this ſprite or phantome, it became
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:174113:34"/>a bugbear, to friten from them an infinity of perſons: and I confeſs to you, that, with this prepoſſeſſion, I my ſelf ſhou'd have found very little difference, between the direction of Jeſuits, and the direction of Antichriſt</p>
               <p>And it appears to me, that thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd <hi>Paſcal</hi> have not done enuff: for upon ſuppoſition of a diſcovery made, of ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and ſuch a plot, actually on foot among the Jeſuits, againſt the Morals of our Savior, they ought, every man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What a ſentence is this you pronounce? ſays <hi>Cleander</hi> laughing: God defend the Jeſuits from falling under the hands of a true down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Janſeniſt, ſo ſevere as you in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I am ſatisfi'd, you wou'd not be long about the work, or do it at twice, but be of the good Religious <hi>Spaniards</hi> humor, who, even while Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> was alive, ſayd very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly,

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:174113:35"/>and that for the execution of this fine project, their Doctors and Directors had, every one, their ſeveral parts mark'd and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out: but he eaſily foreſaw, that, upon his word alone, the work wou'd not be preſently undertaken, he did not expect that this, at firſt, wou'd be believ'd like an article of faith; it was ſufficient for his purpoſe, to make the thing probable: and but only to doubt, or ſuſpect it, was enuff, in the minds of many honeſt Men, to produce the effect he aim'd at: which was, to make them firſt miſtruſt the Jeſuits, and afterwards to baniſh them their companies. More was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for an infinity of people, who have no great good will for them, to engage them to declaim aloud againſt the public diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or to bemoan, in ſoft whiſpers in their friends ears, the general depravation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, occaſion'd by the relaxation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Society: and believe me, thoſe very declamations and bemoanings, alone, are ſufficiently powerful, to prepoſſeſs and fill peoples heads with groundleſs fancies, and obſtinat opinions; which was all that <hi>Paſcal</hi> propos'd to himſelf, or, at leaſt, the party by his means.

Mr. ****, a moſt vertuous and Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Prieſt, advis'd me to break off all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>What do's all this prove, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, and almoſt angry, but that <hi>Paſcal</hi> is the moſt skilful, the moſt malicious, and the moſt dangerous of all impoſtors? and that, by impoſing upon the Jeſuits a crime, as black and grievous, as it is chimerical and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible, he had wit enuff to make plauſible, ſo extravagant a calumny: and that he is guilty of all the falſe and raſh judgments, that have been, already, and ſtill are, daily, made upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>Althô my thoughts, upon this whole matter, are almoſt the ſame with yours, anſwer'd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> yet wou'd I not willingly declare them ſo plainly, and without reſerve. <hi>Paſcal</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor! that's an expreſſion ſeldom made uſe of towards him: he is commonly call'd, the illuſtrious and the admirable Mr. <hi>Paſcal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very well, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> but yet this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, this admirable Mr. <hi>Paſcal,</hi> whom you are ſomewhat ſhy and unwilling to call an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:174113:36"/>impoſtor, was treated in the Court of Juſtice, juſt as impoſtors are us'd to be. His Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Letters were publicly burnt with infamy, by the judgment and order of the Parlament of <hi>Province,</hi> declaring <hi>Them full of calumnies, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, ſuppoſitions, and defamations:</hi> theſe are the expreſs words of the ſentence, which you may read at the end of the Jeſuits anſwers to the Provincial Letters. You may alſo ſee at the end of the ſmall collection made after the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parlament of <hi>Aix,</hi> the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations given by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mechlin</hi> to thoſe Letters;
<note place="margin">Approb. des Ré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſ aux Provinc.</note> 
                  <hi>which</hi> he calls <hi>injurious, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and deceitful impoſtures,</hi> and graces their authors with the title of <hi>inſolent detractors and calumniators.</hi> I remember, added <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that turning over, lately, ſome old papers, I found one concerning this ſubject, and lo here it ſtands upon this ſhelf; it is the judgment given of the Provincial Letters, and <hi>Wendrok's</hi> notes upon them, by certain Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> and Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> who, by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, had had the examination of them.</p>

               <p>What ſay you to this, continues <hi>Eudoxus?</hi> I am of opinion, that if <hi>Paſcals</hi> friends had not been as kind to him, as he was to them, <hi>Paſcal,</hi> the impoſtor, wou'd not have been an expreſſion ſo much out of faſhion, as it is at this day. And I cannot but admire, that the good Fathers, the Jeſuits, can ſuffer
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:174113:37"/>that all this ſhou'd be forgotten by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſcals</hi> friends, anſwers <hi>Cleander,</hi> do give out, that all theſe orders, judgments, and cenſures were obtain'd, purely, by the credit, intereſt, and intrigues of the Fathers of the Society.</p>
               <p>They muſt of neceſſity ſay ſo, reply'd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus;</hi> what elſe cou'd they poſſibly ſay? but are we, I pray you, bound to believe them? althô there had been no other thing, in the Provincial Letters falſe, but this one funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental article, which of it ſelf falls to the ground, the order of the Council of State, and the decree of the Parlament of <hi>Province,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Mechlin's</hi> cenſure wou'd have been moſt juſt and equitable: and this very thing alone wou'd have been a ſtrong prejudice againſt all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Nothing of prejudice, I beſeech you, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> interrupting him: be but a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; you ſeem too much diſturb'd: we have hitherto judg'd by pure reaſon, and not by paſſion; let us continue to do ſo ſtill. The Jeſuits politics, in this reſpect, is a meer chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera, a fooliſh fancy: <hi>Paſcals</hi> ſyſtem has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it of likelihood, or probability; if the Jeſuits have corrupted our Morals, it was not by concert or agreement with one another; and <hi>Paſcals</hi> Janſeniſt has not done prudently, in declaring, ſo ſtrongly, in the fifth Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Letter, againſt what they ſayd to him, that the diverſity of deciſions, among the Jeſuit Divines, did not proceed ſo much, from a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:174113:37"/>plot and conſpiracy, as from too great a liberty they all took, of ſaying whatever came into their thoughts: he ſhou'd have reſerv'd for himſelf this loophole in caſe of neceſſity: but, in ſpite of his teeth, notwithſtanding all his evaſions he muſt have recourſe to that at laſt. Let us then examin whether he be not more ſincere in the remainder, and whether the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits cauſe be as good, and as eaſy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in the other points, as in this. Let whatever <hi>Paſcal</hi> has ſayd, upon the empty and idle ſuppoſition of two kinds of Directors, go for nothing: this is a childiſh fancy, and a perfect jeſt, without the leaſt appearance of truth. Let us not ſuffer our ſelves to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd, by theſe malicious and artificial trics, which, having no ſolid foundation, ſubſiſts but in the air, in the brains of whimſical men. <hi>Behold my Fathers, a further effect, a greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, of your politics, and a more pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of your wicked deſigns;</hi> together with a hundred more ſuch like diſcourſes; all this is but whip'd cream, a phantaſtical bubble, which is far from being ſolid, and ſignifies juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Let us, if you pleaſe, begin firſt with the examination of the article of probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the foundation and ground-work if you'll believe <hi>Paſcal</hi> of the Jeſuits policy. With all my heart, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus:</hi> but the matter is difficult and curious, and I know not whether we ſhall be able to compaſs it, without the help and aſſiſtance of ſome others.</p>

               <head>The Third Diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CLeander,</hi> coming to <hi>Eudoxus's</hi> houſe, where they were to go on with their confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, found there the Abbot of *** a learned man, but free, openhearted, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upright, about fifty years old, and one, who, in all his life, cou'd never endure to ſee men tric and deceive others: he cou'd not comprehend, how men cou'd poſſibly be inſincere, and cou'd eaſily pardon all faults, but that of double dealing; which aſtoniſh'd and vex'd him ſo much, that he was often tempted, with <hi>Moliér's</hi> man-hater, to renounce and quit the world, to avoid the vexation and diſpleaſure of hearing a cheat and a lyer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and applauded at the expence of truth. <hi>Paſcal</hi> had the honor of being eſteem'd by this Gentleman for ſuch a perſon. The wit, the quaint expreſſions, and the facetious raillery, which he lik'd very well in other works, did not at all move him in the Provincial Letters: he cou'd not bear hearing them commended; and he was wont to ſay, that the only praiſe the authors deſerv'd, was ſuch as ought to be given to a skilful poyſonner, who knew how to mix and prepare his poyſon ſo artificially, that all the world ſhou'd find the taſting of it pleaſant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who us'd to be ſometimes very much delighted with the Abbot's zeal for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, had almoſt upon <hi>Cleander's</hi> coming in,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:174113:38"/>put him into that humor: he had only ſhewn him the ſecond tome of the <hi>Paralelle des Anciens &amp; des Modernes,</hi> and ask'd him, whether he had ever read that piece; he look'd upon the title, and having open'd it at a place that was mark'd, he hit upon the panegyric of the Provincial Letters; of which he had no ſooner read three or four lines, than he threw it down, ſaying, he neither had, nor ever wou'd, read that book: is it poſſible added he, with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the public will never be reveng'd on theſe Letters, for their inſolence, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts they put upon the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> Divines, our Religion and it's defenders; and that, after this book has been condem'd to the fire, both by the Eccleſiaſtic, and the Secular tribunals, any one ſhou'd dare, publicly, to give it ſuch extravagant praifes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleander,</hi> who cou'd not forbear laughing at the emotion and vexation wherein he ſaw the Abbot: ſaluted him, and told him, that his reſolution cou'd not but be very obliging to them two, who were then actually buſy in drawing up an inditement againſt the perſon he was ſo angry at. <hi>Eudoxus</hi> further telling him, that he wou'd do them a ſingular pleaſure, to aſſiſt them with his notions and knowledge in a matter, wherein they had great need of his help. But we love, ſays he, to examin things calmly, without heat or paſſion: and therefore we entreat you wou'd a little moderate that zeal which has ſo much tranſported you.</p>
               <p>What do you trouble your ſelves about?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:174113:39"/>reply'd the Abbot briskly: moderation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neceſſary in Judges; and I perceive you two have a mind to make your ſelves ſuch in this cauſe. But as for my ſelf, I am already fix'd in the matter. I have choſen my part, and have long ſince known, what I ought to think, both of this book, and of it's author, and from this moment I do declare my ſelf the accuſer and proſecutor both of the one and of the other: and a little warmth in acting this part, will not perhaps be very unbecoming</p>
               <p>This is the beſt in the world, anſwer'd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> but, turning himſelf to <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> he added: let us be upon our guard, and not ſuffer, that the eſteem we have for the Abbot, ſhou'd make us too favorable to the Jeſuits, or too averſe to <hi>Paſcal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I eſteem the Jeſuits, reply'd the Abbot; but it is not their intereſt which encourages me to this undertaking, but only the love of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd innocence and truth; and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtrange prepoſſeſſion men have, in favor of this book; wherein means are daily us'd to confirm thouſands, who wou'd quickly come off, and quit their good opinion, if they wou'd but reflect upon the cauſes that produc'd this maſter-piece of calumny. All the world knows, that this work, is a work of recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The Church had declar'd the Janſeniſts heretics; it was afterwards neceſſary they ſhou'd make their adverſaries appear, at leaſt, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of Morals. But tell me I pray what piece of this large ſubject were you upon? we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:174113:39"/>have yet met, but once, about this matter, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> and we have already done the Society juſtice, in a point of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: it is about the liberty <hi>Paſcal</hi> has taken, to make himſelf and others ſport with the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem he has fram'd of the Jeſuits politics; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a conſpiracy between the Caſuiſts, Directors, and Superiors of this Society, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel and the Morals of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, for the glory and eſtabliſhment of their Society, at the price of their own damnation, and the damnation of an infinit number of other Souls. You may therefore reckon upon't, that neither <hi>Cleander</hi> nor I, are to be dup'd, or foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d, upon <hi>Paſcal's</hi> word, into the belief of ſo incredible a thing as that, which has not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to us to carry along with it, even the leaſt ſhadow, or reſemblance of truth.</p>
               <p>How, replys the Abbot, do you think that ever <hi>Paſcal</hi> himſelf believ'd it? or that even Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> did? althô that, by an exceſs of honeſty, this Gentleman always ſeem'd, almoſt in all his books, to take for granted the truth of this matter of fact, the moſt chimerical and fantaſtical, that ever was invented?</p>
               <p>That which we are now to examin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> is the article of probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made the foundation of all the Jeſuits policy, and which he calls the <hi>A, B, C,</hi> of their Morals. It is by that, he endeavors to give ſome color to that pleaſant diviſion of accommoding and ſevere Directors: in which point, if you'll believe him, they are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:174113:40"/>agreed among themſelves. Nothing is now ſpoken of but the doctrin of probability; this is the common ſubject of prattle and diſcourſe among the devotes and among the libertines. Some rage and ſtorm againſt it, others make a jeſt of it, and very few dare defend it. The very Curat, of my little Village, ſpent lately above half the time of his Homily or Sermon, in arguing againſt the doctrin of probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. In a word, the ſtorm and outrage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, is grown, in a manner, not only violent, but univerſal: and all the faults, that are found, all the ills, that are ſayd of it, are commonly put to the Jeſuits account; who, in the mean time, are ſilent, and ſay nothing: you wou'd do us no ſmall pleaſure to tell us your thoughts of this matter.</p>
               <p>What I think of it, anſwers the Abbot, is, that a man, who is never ſo little skill'd in this thing, needs but know how to make uſe of the firſt principles of common ſenſe and reaſon, to ſee, clearly, the great diſhoneſty of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> the injuſtice he has done his adverſaries, and the ill ways he has taken, to obtain the end, he drove at, which was to decry and run them down, and make them odious to all the world.</p>
               <p>What terrible propoſitions are theſe you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance? ſayd <hi>Cleander.</hi> If I do not prove them, anſwer'd the Abbot, I am content to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by you, and by all honeſt men, for a knave and a calumniator: and if you can juſtify <hi>Paſcal</hi> in this point, I do engage, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the war, to go away to morrow morning,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:174113:40"/>to ſearch for Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> or in <hi>Holland,</hi> that I may, before him, ſolemly profeſs and declare my ſelf a Janſeniſt. In the mean time will you but hear me make out what I have aſſerted?</p>
               <p>After, that <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> had a while jeſted, with the Abbot, about his voiage to <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> he began, in earneſt, to prove, what he had advanc'd.</p>
               <p>The injury, ſayd he, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> has done the Jeſuits, do's not conſiſt, in the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the doctrin of probable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: it is chiefly in this, that he charges that doctrin upon them alone, althô they have ſayd nothing in it, but what has been ſayd by other Societies, even before their's was inſtituted, or ever thought of. For what can one think, when they ſee a man, by printed writings, ſpread, not only in <hi>Paris,</hi> but alſo all over <hi>France,</hi> citing and dragging the Jeſuits before the public Tribunal, and crying out for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice, againſt them, in particular and by name; aſſuring us that he has diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the ſource and ſecret of all their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maxims; and pretending to convince the Divines, the Directors and Superiors of this body, of introducing, teaching, and practiſing a doctrin, which authoriſeth the moſt exceſſive irregularities; ſuffers men to enjoy and gratify, freely, the moſt brutal of their appetites and paſſions; and which turns the pure laws of Chriſtianity into the filthy ſenſual Religion of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> calling them to an account, in a moſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:174113:41"/>pathetic manner, for the many ſouls they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and damn every day: and, laſtly, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe terrible opinions, as the particular and ſpecific doctrin of the Society; and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every where, an allarum againſt the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and with ſo great a hubbub, that one cou'd not but think, that all the Doctors and Divines, in Chriſtendom, were to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd to a <hi>Croiſade,</hi> a war of Religion, againſt the moſt dangerous and moſt deſtructive ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Chriſtianity. What idea, what character was there then given of the Jeſuits? what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and what juſtice was there in all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; if it be true, that the Jeſuits are as innocent as all other Orders and Divines; or if theſe are full as much, or more criminal than the Jeſuits?</p>
               <p>Althô the doctrin of probable opinions were as pernicious as <hi>Paſcal</hi> pretends, and as he has perſuaded a world of people to believe, by the falſe gloſſes and expoſitions he has given of it in his Letters, yet wou'd the Jeſuits crime have been very much leſſen'd, if the reader had been advertis'd, that this doctrin was not particular to them, but the common doctrin of all the Catholic Schools, of the Divines, both of <hi>Louvain</hi> and of <hi>Paris.</hi> The world, upon this ſingle advertiſment, wou'd, perhaps, have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their judgments concerning even the quality of this doctrin: and ſeeing it painted in ſuch horrible colors, wou'd have been firſt fully ſatisfi'd, before they gave their opinions, of the ſincerity of him that drew it's picture,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:174113:41"/>or made the report. And, without doubt, men cou'd not have been ſo unjuſt, as to ſuffer that all the curſes, which ſo abominable an error had deſerv'd, ſhou'd fall upon the Jeſuits alone. They wou'd not have layd the whole burden on their backs, but at leaſt have given others their ſhare; and, perhaps, wou'd have favor'd, if not pardon'd them, for having ſin'd but by the example of thoſe, whoſe rank, profeſſion and learning, had gain'd them the title and quality, of Doctors and Maſters. But that, in the language of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> the looſe Morals, and the Jeſuits Morals ſhou'd become ſynonimous expreſſions, and ſignify one and the ſame thing to an infinit number of people: that the Libertins and heady obſtinat Devotes, and often the envious and intereſſed, ſhou'd ſo underſtand them in their converſations, in their books and in their pulpits; and, laſtly, that the cabal ſhou'd obtain their end, of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing their own doctrin, and giving it an extraordinary luſter, by oppoſing it, to that of all the Catholic Divines, whoſe footſteps the Jeſuit Fathers have but trod in, is in truth an injuſtice one cannot ſee, without horror and indignation.</p>
               <p>Mr Abbot, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him, no body can agree better than you do; but the propoſition you lay down, muſt be clearly prov'd; if what you ſay be true, that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits doctrin is no other, than what has been taught in all the Catholic Schools of the Church, not only <hi>Paſcal,</hi> is very unjuſt, in making all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:174113:42"/>the blame of it light upon the Jeſuits, but alſo, as you have very well obſerv'd, the notice, or previous knowledge of that alone, wou'd have made men think, that this doctrin in it ſelf, is not ſo bad as he endeavors to make the world believe; but this is a matter of fact, for the making out of which, we ſhall have need of a compleat library.</p>
               <p>If I had foreſeen, reply'd the Abbot, this occaſion of defending ſo good a cauſe, I ſhou'd have brought in my pocket all the library we ſhall have uſe for; which is but a ſmall book of forty or fifty pages, intituled <hi>Quaeſtio ſacti,</hi> which plainly ſhews, that the doctrin of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, is not a doctrin, particular to the Jeſuits. The author recounts, and runs over all the moſt famous Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as the Schools of all Religious Orders; and there ſhews, that of all the authors, not Jeſuits, who had treated, or touch'd, even by the by, the queſtion of probable opinions, of whom he makes a very long liſt; he ſhews, I ſay, that to the year 1659, when he made this ſmall piece, there was but one of them all, by name <hi>Antony Perez,</hi> who went a little aſtray in one point, from the common doctrin of all others; of which very point, in particular charity to the Jeſuits, they wou'd fain give them alone the whole honor. He further adds, and proves it admirably well, that the moſt learned Divines of the Society have, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, reſtrain'd this doctrin; which ſome preceding Doctors ſeem'd to have exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:174113:42"/>too far: and at laſt quotes a Jeſuit author <hi>Comitolus,</hi> for the only man, who had attack'd and fallen upon the opinions of all other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in the ſeveral parts of this matter: and from whom he pretends, that <hi>Wendrok</hi> has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his ſtrongeſt arguments, for the refutation of the doctrin of probability.</p>
               <p>From all which, the author, of this little work, concludes two things: the firſt, that it is againſt all the laws of equity, to oblige the Jeſuits to juſtify and make good an opinion, which was common to them, with all other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines: the ſecond, that if it be a glory, to have abſolutely declar'd againſt this doctrin, this glory, till then was particular, and only due to the Jeſuits: and he complains of <hi>Wendrok,</hi> that being ſo much oblig'd to this <hi>Comitolus,</hi> he did not do him the favor, when he quoted him, to give the reader notice, that he was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Society. You are very lucky then Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> for I have in my pocket this little book you ſo much value; and having ſpoken of it to <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> in our former conference, I have now brought it with me to ſhew him: and here it is.</p>
               <p>The Abbot immediatly took the book into his hands, and running it over with <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> he preſently counted nine or ten Biſhops, that is to ſay, almoſt all of this character, who have handled theſe matters, ſince the time of Saint <hi>Antonin,</hi> who is comprehended in this number: and he alſo read him the paſſages, and the names of the books, and the number
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:174113:43"/>of the pages, whence theſe things, relating to this ſubject are taken. Afterwards he made him read the opinions of three famous Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> who have publiſh'd whole bodyes of Divinity. Mr. <hi>Gamache, Iſambert,</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi> to whom this author has added Mr. <hi>Bail,</hi> a Doctor of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitenciary of the Cathedral Church of that City; and at laſt he ſhew'd him in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapters the unanimous agreement upon this point, of all the <hi>Thomiſt</hi> Doctors, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi> and of the <hi>Scotiſt Franciſcans,</hi> and other Religious Orders, together with the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Louvain, Salamanca</hi> and <hi>Alcala,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> there never was any doctrin, leſs particular to the Jeſuits, than this doctrin of probable opinions. But Mr. Abbot, added he, have you your ſelf ſeen all theſe paſſages and quotations confirm'd? and have you compar'd them with the text in the original authors quoted?</p>
               <p>As to this, anſwer'd the Abbot, I will ſay three things: the firſt, that the author of this little treatiſe is Father <hi>Dechamps,</hi> a Jeſuit, a very exact and ſure writer, a man honor'd for his vertue with the eſteem of the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons of the Kingdom, and of ſuch of the very Janſeniſts themſelves, as know him: the ſecond, that nothing has been written to prove theſe quotations falſe, now for above thirty years, ſince the book was publiſh'd, which I am very confident wou'd not have been omitted, had the author given the leaſt ground
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:174113:43"/>for it. I know but one Divine, a <hi>Dominican,</hi> call'd Father <hi>Baronius,</hi> that objects, weakly enuff, to Father <hi>Dechamps</hi> ſome circumſtances, which ſignify nothing to the main eſſential point in hand, concerning the manner wherein it is propos'd and maintain'd by this Jeſuit; the third is, that of this great number of paſſages, I my ſelf have examin'd and found at leaſt thirty of them true, of which I can ſpeak with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and aſſurance. I will ſhew them you, when ever you will, in two or three librarys belonging to ſome communities in <hi>Paris;</hi> where we ſhall alſo find ſome part of thoſe which have not yet fallen under my hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eudoxus</hi> having in his library the three <hi>Paris</hi> Doctors and ſome <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> they immediatly without further delay fell to the examining the firſt, every of them taking one of them in hand to ſearch for the paſſages quoted in this little book.</p>
               <p>The Abbot, having read them very often, knew the preciſe pages, therefore opening that volume of <hi>Iſamberts,</hi> where he treats of Saint <hi>Thomas's Prima ſecundae,</hi> ſhew'd them the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of probable opinions, handled from page 133 to page 140, there this methodical Divine gives firſt the definitions of the terms, and tells us what a probable opinion is, and what a more probable opinion: after which he puts the queſtion in the ſecond article; <q>Whether it be lawful to follow a probable conſcience, or a probable opinion:</q> which queſtion he himſelf thus anſwers. <q>When our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:174113:44"/>conſcience tells us, that it is probably law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honeſt, to do a thing, we cannot by doing that thing be guilty of any ſin: this, adds he, is the common opinion of all Divines: and then he propounds a ſecond propoſition. When there are, ſays he, two opinions, equally probable, touching the lawfulneſs of doing any thing, one may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow which of the two he pleaſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the following article he himſelf makes this objection of theſe two opinions, one is, that the thing is forbidden, the other, that it is permitted: the firſt is ſafe, becauſe one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin mortally by following it; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is not certain. I anſwer, adds he, that it is lawful to follow the leaſt ſure: and I prove it thus.......</p>
               <p>See the title of his fourth article. <hi>When there is a diſpute about the doing or not doing of a thing, and that there are two probable opinions thereupon, is it lawful, to quit that which is more probable, and to follow that which is leſs probable?</hi> he thus reſolves this queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When there are two ſuch probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions, that the one is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable than the other, it is lawful to leave the more probable, and follow that which is probable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this he propounds ſome difficulties, and in particular this rule of law. <hi>That in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſes one is to take the ſureſt ſide.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>That one muſt diſtinguiſh, and not confound doubt with opinion,</hi> and directs his reader to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:174113:44"/>precedent article, where he made a more full explanation of the ſenſe, wherein that maxim is to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Laſtly in the ſixth article, num. 8. <q>When there are, ſays he, two opinions, one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the other more probable, and that this alſo is more ſafe, and the other leſs ſafe, about my obligation of doing a thing that relates to my ſelf: I am not oblig'd by the charity which I ow my ſelf, to act by the more probable and more ſafe opinion; but I may without ſin, quit the more ſafe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and follow that opinion which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, thô leſs ſafe; as before I have ſhewn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> after he had read this paſſage, Father <hi>Dechamps</hi> has, not only, not made <hi>Iſambert</hi> ſay too much, but has even forgot a great deal of what he had written.</p>
               <p>This is not yet all, anſwer'd the Abbot; let us ſee what this Doctor ſays, upon the conſequences or dependances of the doctrin of probabilities. Whereupon he read the fifth article: where the author demands; whether a Doctor, conſulted in a caſe of conſcience, may anſwer according to the probable opinion, and not according to the more probable, althô he himſelf were of this laſt opinion: after he had clear'd and expounded the ſeveral ſenſes or meanings, wherein this queſtion might be taken, he anſwer'd. <q>That a Doctor thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, was to conſider the circumſtances of the matter, which may happen to be ſuch, that he may not only anſwer according to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:174113:45"/>leſs probable opinion, againſt the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but that alſo it might be imprudent to do otherwiſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us go on a little further, continu'd the Abbot, and read the eighth and ninth article. The title of the firſt was. <hi>Is it lawful to act againſt ones own opinion, and follow that of others? the meaning of this article is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſambert</hi> adds. <q>Thoſe that hold, that this is lawful, of whoſe opinion I am, do follow the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which is not that of <hi>Adrian,</hi> but is the opinion of almoſt all Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The title of the ninth article is. <hi>Whether a man be ſometimes oblig'd to follow the probable opinion of others, contrary to his own, which alſo is probable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The anſwer is, that there are ſome caſes, wherein it is not only lawful, to act, againſt one's own opinion, but alſo where a Man is bound in conſcience, to act according to the probable opinion of another, contrary to his own, thô this alſo be ſuppos'd probable?</q> and ſuch may be the caſe of a Confeſſor, that hears the confeſſion of a penitent, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion, upon ſome points of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, is contrary to his own: and that alſo of an inferior, commanded by his ſuperior to do a thing probably lawful, but which, in the opinion of the inferior, is not probably law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Confeſſor is oblig'd, according to <hi>Iſambert,</hi> to follow the opinion of his penitent, and the inferior, that of his ſuperior.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:174113:45"/>
               <p>And take notice, adds the Abbot, that <hi>Iſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> quotes Saint <hi>Antonin</hi> for his opinion, only with this reſtriction, that if the Confeſſor be the penitent's Paſtor, he is oblig'd to comply with the penitents probable opinion, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him; but if the penitent be not of his flock, one of his pariſh, he may then refuſe to give him abſolution.</p>
               <p>That which you now ſay, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> ſeems to me a little hard: but the authority of Saint <hi>Antonin,</hi> and the reaſons with which Mr. <hi>Iſambert</hi> ſupports his opinion, perſuades me, at leaſt, to believe, that it is not ſo eaſy, as one may think, to give a poſitive judgment in theſe matters. As far as I ſee, continu'd he, if <hi>Paſcal</hi> had but taken the fancy in his Provincial Letters, to make Mr. <hi>Iſambert</hi> ſpeak in the name of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> inſtead of the good Jeſuit that ſpeaks in the name of the Society, he wou'd have found matter enuff to have made him act the ſame kind of part.</p>
               <p>He might have made, reply'd the Abbot, if he had had a mind to it, even Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf ſay as ridiculous things, as thoſe he has put into the Jeſuits mouth: for this, it wou'd have been enuff to have only propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and handſomly put into order, ſeveral points of this learned Saints doctrin, as he has done the Jeſuits: without ſetting down the proofs, the reſtrictions, the explications, and the neceſſary precautions for making the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them lawful. But I will yet further ſuppoſe, that if a libertin wou'd make a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:174113:46"/>of all the falſe propoſitions, that have ſlip'd from the holy Fathers, and give beſides to ſome of their other expreſſions, the ill ſenſe of which they are capable, mangle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſome paſſages, and leave out, or put in, here and there, a few words, he might make a book of them, much bigger than the Provincial Letters: and might as juſtly intitle it. <hi>The Religion and Morals of the Fathers</hi> as a certain book was formerly call'd, <hi>The Moral Divinity of the Jeſuits,</hi> of which the Provincial Letters are but extracts, enlarg'd upon. And another of a much greater extent which has been ſince publiſh'd under the name of <hi>The Jeſuits Morals.</hi> And which was alſo publicly burnt at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1670, upon the teſtimony of ſeveral of the Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> for a ſcurrilous defamatory libel, full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, calumnies, falſifications and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was, as is ſayd, the work of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Doctor <hi>Perrault,</hi> Brother to your <hi>Perrault</hi> the author of <hi>Parallele de anciens &amp; des Modernes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am no longer aſtoniſh'd, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that the Provincial Letters ſhou'd have put this man into ſuch raptures and extravagant fits of enthuſiaſme: both the Brothers were I perceive poſſeſs'd and animated by the ſame kind of ſpirit. But let us I pray, ſayd the Abbot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our buſineſs. The queſtion, at preſent, is not whether the doctrin taught by Mr. <hi>Iſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> be good or bad doctrin: the merit and reputation of this great Divine ought, at leaſt, to oblige us to ſuſpend our judgment a while.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:174113:46"/>The point we are now upon, and, by what you ſee with your own eyes, is moſt certain, is, that the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> as learned and as Catholic then as at this day, heard, without horror, a doctrin, daily inſtil'd from their chairs which being found in the Jeſuits books they wou'd make paſs for a dangerous and curſed doctrin. But give me leave, and I will, in a moment, find the places you ſeek for in Mr. <hi>Du-val</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gamache.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have found this in Mr. <hi>Gamache,</hi> ſayd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> it is in the 155 page, and not in 153 as Father <hi>Dechamps</hi> Printer has plac'd it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His firſt aſſertion is.</hi> 
                  <q>That in the court of conſcience a man is not oblig'd to follow the more probable opinion, it is enuff to follow an opinion abſolutely probable, approv'd by learned men, till ſuch time as the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares againſt it, or that the Divines reject and baniſh it from their Schools. <hi>Navar. Medina.</hi> But, in the mean time, one muſt take care, not to give ſcandal to the weak, by his exterior actions and muſt likewiſe have a regard to cuſtom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Who are theſe weak, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, are they not the Janſeniſts, who are ſo much ſcandalis'd at this doctrin? O my God anſwer'd the Abbot, the Phariſaic ſcandal, which in Divinity they oppoſe to the ſcandal of the weak, is, much more to be fear'd for them. You are always ſevere and ill humor'd towards the Janſeniſts, reply'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> but ſuffer me, I pray you, to make an end of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:174113:47"/>this paſſage, there are but two words more in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>His ſecond aſſertion is.</hi> That the Confeſſor, whether the proper Paſtor, or one deputed by him, may abſolve his penitents againſt his own opinion, when they are of an opinion both leſs certain and leſs ſafe; provided it be a probable opinion and back'd with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſome Catholic and learned authors; and in this caſe, he not only may, but is alſo bound to give them abſolution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is certainly enuff of this, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> let us ſee, whether Mr. <hi>Du-val</hi> will ſay as much. Here I have the place ready; it is in his treatiſe of human actions. <hi>q.</hi> 4. <hi>a.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 115. in the paragraph intitled <hi>quid agendum ſit in conſcientia opinativa.</hi> Where he has, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt word for word, the ſame expreſſions which Mr. <hi>Gamache</hi> has made uſe of.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond concluſion is, that in the Court of conſcience a man is not oblig'd to follow the more probable opinion, but it is ſufficient to follow one, that is probable, and approv'd by able and learned perſons, althô contrary to the ſenſe of other learned men; which yet is to be underſtood with ſome reſtriction: that is to ſay, that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is no more to be follow'd, if the Church determin the contrary, or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines baniſh it from their Schools. It is the opinion of <hi>Medina</hi> and <hi>Navar in cap. ſiquis de paenit.</hi> Where they poſitively teach, that there is no obligation, to follow the more ſafe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:174113:47"/>and that it is enuff to follow an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which is ſafe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> with <hi>Cleander,</hi> was reading the remaining part of <hi>Du-val's</hi> doctrin, about probable opinions, the Abbot meeting with Mr. <hi>Bail's</hi> book <hi>de triplici examine</hi> ſpake to them in theſe words. Let us, I pray you, do this Doctor of <hi>Paris</hi> alſo the honor of conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, he was ſubpenitentiary of our Lady's Church, a man, much valued, and very fit for his employment; thus he writes upon this ſubject. <q>Althô many do univerſally teach in all parts of the Church, that one may, in conſcience, ſafely follow the leſs probable opinion; it ſeems to me notwithſtanding that this doctrin ought to be limited and reſtrain'd to the matter of precepts, and not extended to the matter of Sacraments.</q> Theſe words are in the 47 page of his fifth edition <hi>de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine paenitentium.</hi> You underſtand what he wou'd be at. He pretends, that a man may not follow the leſs probable opinion, in a doubt relating to the matter of Sacraments, for ſome particular reaſons, but only when the matter doubted of, relates to precepts, or commands, or to the knowledge, whether ſuch or ſuch a thing be lawful or not lawful.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee what he ſays in the foregoing page, where he ſpeaks like a wiſe man, who perceiv'd, that this doctrin might be miſtaken and do miſchief, by accounting an opinion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that was not probable; but who, at the ſame time, ſhews himſelf perſuaded, that an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:174113:48"/>opinion, when certainly probable, may be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd: <q>For which cauſe, ſayd he, it ſeems to me, that the doctrin of probability, which is become the common doctrin, has not been yet clear'd and diſentangled from difficulties, as much as the importance of the matter do's require and deſerve. I wiſh ſome able Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines wou'd take the pains, to conſider and reſolve all the intricacies and objections which attend it. Not that I am not perſuaded, but that he who follows a probable opinion, go's a ſure way, how convenient ſoever it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: for that way is ſure, which makes us avoid ſin, and any opinion, which is truly probable, thô the leſs probable of two, will notwithſtanding ſecure us from ſin. I do hold, and am perſuaded, that a man is freed before God from ſin, by following a probable opinion, and that he cannot be thereby guilty, even, of a venial ſin.</q> What ſay you now to this?</p>
               <p>That which I ſay to it, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> is, that, moſt certainly, <hi>Paſcal</hi> and thoſe who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him with memoirs ſtudied only among the Jeſuits, and had read no other but their Divines. Beſides Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> cou'd not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have ſeen the Provincial Letters before they were publiſh'd. For with what conſcience cou'd he ſuffer the Jeſuits to be defam'd, for the authors of a doctrin, he himſelf ſaw pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly taught in <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> by the Profeſſors of his own time? but for his having ſince endeavor'd, as he ſtill daily do's, to make theſe Letters
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:174113:48"/>gain credit, be more and more valued, and their contents improv'd, to the prejudice of the Jeſuits, there muſt ſurely be ſome ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we are ignorant of: for extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who exceed the common rate of men, and are engag'd in mighty matters, as the heads or leaders of a great party, whoſe reputation they are to ſupport, may poſſibly have, for themſelves, ſome particular rules of conſcience, which all the world have not a right to follow.</p>
               <p>What, ſayd the Abbot, after ſuch evident matters of fact, as theſe we have read, will you not plainly own as I do, that <hi>Paſcal, Arnauld,</hi> and all other heads of the party who in this, and things of like nature, cannot ſin thro' ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, are downright cheats and perfect hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, that abuſe the public credulity, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and invenom'd men againſt their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who ſpare nothing they can think of, to deſtroy their reputation? to what end are all theſe ſhiftings, do's not the thing ſpeak of it ſelf, and do not I plainly perceive what your thoughts are?</p>
               <p>One muſt not always ſay what he thinks, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> has yet ſayd leſs of the matter than I.</p>
               <p>I am almoſt angry, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> at this wicked Abbot: who has turn'd all my noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons topſie-turvie; I was in a very good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and well diſpos'd to make you and my ſelf ſome ſport with theſe good Fathers, the Jeſuits, upon the ſubject of probabilities; and now I begin to feel ſome remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:174113:49"/>for the raſh judgments I formerly made, a thouſand times, of them.</p>
               <p>I have not yet done with you, ſayd the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot. I have ſtill matter enuff to ſhew you, to encreaſe your ſcruples: but before I come to that, or make you ſee that the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> the <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> and almoſt all other Divines, ſpeak upon this point, the language of the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> and have, with them, and the Jeſuits, an equal right, to ſhare in the fine title of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Morals. I will read you an admirable and remarkable paſſage of <hi>Wendrok</hi> upon this occaſion, in his notes on the Provincial Letters. You know, that theſe notes were read, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and approv'd, by <hi>Paſcal</hi> himſelf; reach me down I pray you <hi>Wendroks</hi> book.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits, continu'd the Abbot, made lowd complaints of the injuſtice done 'um, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to make them, alone, anſwerable, for all the real, or pretended relaxations in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Them I ſay, who taught nothing in Morals, but the common doctrin, and who, being the laſt comers, did but tread in the paths trac'd out, by thoſe that went before them.
<note place="margin">wendrok in prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quio.</note> Upon this <hi>Wendrok</hi> makes a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place, and pronounces this fine ſentence. That having partners do's not excuſe a crime: and afterwards adds. <hi>Paſcal</hi> wou'd have been well employ'd indeed, and ſpent his time to good purpoſe, in gathering together, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many impertinent books, to find out, whether the Jeſuits only were wicked and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fellows, <hi>An ſoli Jeſuitae flagitioſi fuerint.</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:174113:49"/>So Mr. <hi>Nicole</hi> expreſſes himſelf in latin. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô the Jeſuits, continued he, had taken their relaxations from ſome others, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in reaſon, they ought to be reputed the authors of them. Why? becauſe, that theſe pernicious doctrins had layn hid in ſome corner of a library, known to very few, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, cou'd not do much hurt: but the Jeſuits have drawn them out of their lurking holes, and preach'd them upon the houſe tops; introduc'd them into Princes Courts, to privat men's houſes, the Courts of Judicature and the Magiſtracy. Behold, added the Abbot, the writings of an infinity of Divines put into the number of impertinent books, and the Doctors and Profeſſors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> accounted men of no value or conſideration: their Divinity School compar'd to that of the Jeſuits, is but like a ſmall Village in compariſon of <hi>Paris,</hi> and what their famous and moſt illuſtrious Doctors have taught, both by word of mouth, and by prints, is like a chip in pottage and do's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor harm.</p>
               <p>Let us proceed to other things, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him: this is really very inſolent and extravagant.</p>
               <p>The Abbot ſayd no more upon this article, but contented himſelf with this firſt victory, in favor of truth, and a right ſenſe of things, in oppoſition to calumny and a fooliſh obſtinat opinion. For <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> as naturally juſt as he was, was ſtill a little headſtrong and the more, that <hi>Cleander,</hi> who had read the Divines, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:174113:50"/>perceiv'd that the Abbots reflexions might ſtand them in good ſtead, in the examination they had undertaken to make, judg'd fit to take the advantage of it. Mr. Abbot, ſayd he to him, we muſt not ſtand ſtill in ſo fair a road: let us go on I pray, and tell us your thoughts and all you know of this matter.</p>
               <p>With all my heart, ſayd the Abbot, and I will propoſe to you a ſecond matter of fact, for the truth of which, I will, upon the hazard of my honor, be anſwerable; it is, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> and his friends have made of probable opinion a meer ſcarcrow, a man of ſtraw, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and the eaſe of fighting it, with the greater advantage, and of making the Jeſuits father a monſtrous opinion which never was their own.</p>
               <p>For at laſt, by the favor and aſſiſtance of theſe opinions which <hi>Paſcal</hi> combats,
<note place="margin">Lett. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>One Doctor, if people will believe him, may turn and wind mens conſciences,</hi>

                  <hi>backwards and forwards, juſt as he pleaſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lett. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and always ſecurely: make new rules of Morals. A Christian may without any hazard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange himſelf from the rules,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">wendrek in not. ad epiſt. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>which the Scripture, the Councils and the Fathers have preſcrib'd us; and an infidel and a heretic may ſafely continue in their falſe Religion.</hi> This, without doubt, is very horrible, and curſed be the poyſon'd fountain of a doctrin, ſo fatal to Chriſtianity. But who do's <hi>Paſcal</hi> and his tranſlator aim at? for I pray obſerve, what are the two general conditions, that the Jeſuits do require, to make an opinion probable, and that a Divine may hold it for ſuch? firſt, it muſt not be contrary
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:174113:50"/>to the rules of faith; nor, in general, contain any thing oppoſit to the truths receiv'd by the Church, nor be contrary to evident and right reaſon. In the ſecond place, it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with good reaſons, and not lightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to be defended, againſt the common and ordinary opinion of Doctors. Theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are bounds, which limit and reſtrain a Caſuiſt, if any one ſhou'd happen to deſire it, from being able to make <hi>New rules of Morals.</hi> How is it poſſible for men, that take for a rule this notion, which the Jeſuits give in their definitions, of a probable opinion, <hi>To go aſtray without danger from the maxims, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Councils, and the Fathers have mark'd out for us? how can a heretic or an infidel continue ſafely in his falſe Religion?</hi> are the truths, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and allow'd of by the Church, different from thoſe, which the Scripture, the Fathers and the Councils teach us? or can any men, reſpect, or ſet a value on the firſt, without taking the ſecond for a rule?</p>
               <p>If they ſhou'd ſay, that the Jeſuits have not obſerv'd theſe rules, nor follow'd their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, and cou'd prove their having done ſo, without cutting off and falſifying their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, or ſtiching ſeveral of them together; which, being joyn'd, ſeem to ſignify juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to what they really ſignify, when they are ſeverally read in their proper places; I ſhou'd be one of the firſt to oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem them. But let them not ſay, that their principles are monſters, which bring forth other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:174113:51"/>monſtors: nor from the ſilly things, that <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> has made his Jeſuit ſpeak, in his fifth and ſixth Letters, draw, as he do's, concluſions, as impertinent and as extravagant, as they are falſe and wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eudoxus</hi> did, in this alſo, approve the Abbot's reaſoning; but yet deſir'd, he wou'd prove the definition he had given of a probable opinion: for <hi>Wendrok,</hi> ſays he, diſputes the thing, and very few in the world are perſuaded, that the Jeſuits principles in this matter, are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, limited and narrow.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, anſwer'd the Abbot, becauſe moſt people read only the Provincial Letters, and the tranſlator of theſe Letters, and that either they will not, or commonly cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Jeſuits books. An other reaſon is, they do not know, that <hi>Wendrok,</hi> in diſputing this matter of fact, is, not ſincere; and I will immediatly convince you of it. I have in my cloſet ſome extracts, upon this ſubject, drawn by my ſelf, out of the moſt famous Jeſuit Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines: I'le ſtep home and fetch them.</p>
               <p>The Abbot, who dwelt hard by, being gone out, <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> began to make many reflexions. With all our love for truth, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> I know not, whether we ſhou'd have been able, without the Abbot's help, to have got over all theſe rubs; ſince <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok</hi> have ſo imbroil'd and perplex'd things, and that the matter it ſelf is ſo hard, to be clearly diſcuſs'd, and that the too ſtrait-lac'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd Morals are ſupported, by ſuch plauſible
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:174113:51"/>and ſpecious maxims; when on the contrary, the truly Chriſtian Morals are built upon max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, of which ſome appear very ſtrange and unfit to be follow'd or receiv'd before they are well weigh'd and conſider'd, which is hard to be done by common underſtandings: theſe Gentlemen knew very well, how to take the advantage, by the oppoſition they have made between the one and the other. Moreover, they ſpeak with ſo bold and confident an air, that one is, almoſt, afraid to doubt of what they ſay: and they have ſo train'd up, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd a world of people to talk as they do, that their moſt unlikely and improbable para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes are, almoſt, become the public com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion.</p>
               <p>It was not only, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the matter, nor ſome outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, which they knew how to improve, that gave them ſo much advantage over the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. Theſe Fathers did, in truth, make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers which were ſufficiently ſtrong and ſolid; but ſo flat and ill put together (I ſpeak of thoſe which came out firſt) that there was no compariſon between one of <hi>Paſcals</hi> Letters, and the <hi>First anſwer to the Janſenists Letters.</hi> He got thereby ſuch a ſuperiority over them, that he no more look'd upon them, as adverſaries he was ſtill fighting with, but as deſpicable people, baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, foild, and thrown to the ground, trampling them under foot with equal ſcorn and contempt.</p>
               <p>It is very true, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> gain'd wonderfully by this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:174113:52"/>weakneſs: but is it poſſible, that the Jeſuits of thoſe days had no body that cou'd write?</p>
               <p>Father <hi>le Moyne,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> was ſtill living, and I am ſurpriz'd, they did not oppoſe him to <hi>Paſcal:</hi> this Father had an excellent fancy and a world of wit: and his way of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was lively, ſmart and florid: he had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a good reputation among the moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and beſt accompliſh'd perſons: and the apologetic manifeſt, which he writ ſeveral years before againſt the book, call'd <hi>La Theologie Morale des Jéſuites,</hi> was as much in vogue, as his Curry-comb for the Janſeniſt Pegaſus.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the Society did believe, he was not like to outdo or equal <hi>Paſcal's</hi> ſtile, at once ſo eaſy, and ſo delicat. For Father <hi>le Moyne's</hi> great fault was, that his words were not well choſen, or very proper, that he us'd not to dreſs, ſet out and embelliſh his thoughts, with various, neat, and quaint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: that he was always witty, but never endeavor'd, to expreſs himſelf plainly, or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly: and it may be, he himſelf did not think, he was an equal match for him, in this kind of combat, and therefore was not willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. But whatever the matter was then, 'tis plain the Jeſuits do not, now want, ſtore of good writers, and that they knew how to be gainers by their firſt defeat. Within ten or eleven years after the Provincial Letters were publiſh'd, there came forth a Letter to a Lord at Court..........</p>
               <p>The author of that is known, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:174113:52"/>interrupting him, and the man of the world the Society ought, at that time, to have ſet up in oppoſition to <hi>Paſcal.</hi> He underſtood raillery very well, and wou'd not have been troubled or vex'd as the Jeſuits then were; but wou'd have given him as good as he brought, a Rowland for his Oliver, and have anſwer'd him in the ſame tone and language. Had this been done, the people wou'd, at leaſt, have compar'd the Letters and the Anſwers: whereas in thoſe days they hardly regarded what became of the Jeſuits. But for theſe nine or ten years paſt, they have both defended themſelves and attack'd their adverſaries, with vigor:
<note place="margin">La De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe des noaveaux Chreſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens &amp; des Miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naires do la Chine.</note> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking of <hi>The defence of the new Chriſtians and the Miſſioners of</hi> China, which gave the party a wound that ſtill bleeds: you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that upon the ſubject of <hi>The Philoſophic ſin,</hi> there were four or five ſmall books made, in behalf of the Jeſuits, which were extreamly well receiv'd, and with good reaſon:
<note place="margin">Peché Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phique.</note> for they fell upon Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> and his friends juſt where they ſhou'd, where they lay moſt open, caught them faſt, and wou'd not let go their hold, but ſtill purſuing their advantage, they did not only fully diſprove them, but alſo took them up roundly, and told them their own to ſome purpoſe: bringing them always back to certain unanſwerable points: as for example, to the ſubmiſſion which they ow, but do not pay, to the lawful powers, and to ſome noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious palpable falſifications, of which they were convicted, beyond the poſſibility of a reply.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:174113:53"/>All this is inconvenient for theſe Gentlemen, who love not to be upon the defenſive, and who find it much eaſier to attack others, than to defend themſelves. But now concerning the Jeſuits, who ventur'd to write againſt <hi>Paſcal,</hi> what think you of Father <hi>Annat;</hi> the author of the book call'd <hi>Janſeniſt ſincerity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">La bonne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Father <hi>Annat,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> was, in my opinion, an excellent wit: and the Jeſuits have publiſh'd nothing better, than what was written by him, upon the matters which were then in diſpute. This honeſt good man (who beſides theſe two vertues, poſſeſſed that alſo of modeſty, in the higheſt perfection poſſible) had a tallent for writing, even in <hi>French,</hi> if he had a little more apply'd himſelf to the ſtudy of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; there fell from his pen, from time to time, as fine, as lively, as pleaſant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtrokes as ever I ſaw in my life.</p>
               <p>I am of your opinion, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> and without ſaying any thing of his vertue, which I have heard commended, even by this very party, I have found him, as you have done, very exact in his judgment, and ſometimes to expreſs himſelf with great quaintneſs and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, which, let me tell you, is a thing very rare and extraordinary for a School Divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> were entertaining one another in this manner, when the Abbot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd: and took out of his letter caſe, a piece which juſtified the matters of fact he had
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:174113:53"/>aſſerted. This was a collection, of paſſages, concerning the doctrin of probable opinions, extracted out of the books of ſeveral Jeſuit Divines, and, eſpecially, out of thoſe which <hi>Paſcal</hi> in his Letters treats ſo very ſcurvily.</p>
               <p>My paper, ſays he, begins very properly with reference to the buſineſs in hand: it is out of <hi>Layman,</hi> whom <hi>Wendrok</hi> quotes in his notes upon the fifth Provincial Letter, to ſhew, that the Jeſuits were in the wrong, when they complain'd that their doctrin was alter'd, on purpoſe to make it odious: he ought to be ſatisfied, that we govern our ſelves, in this matter, by the teſtimony he himſelf gives us, of the matter of fact. Theſe are this Jeſuits own words.</p>
               <p>A probable opinion, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notion, may be defin'd.
<note place="margin">Layman. tra. 1. cap. 5. parag 2. num. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>An opinion which is not certain, but which, notwithstanding, is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a conſiderable authority, or upon ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reaſon: and an opinion ought to be judg'd, ſupported by a conſiderable authority, when it is, at leaſt, the opinion of a learned, and an honeſt man. Wendrok</hi> cites only this place in <hi>Layman,</hi> to ſhew, that the Jeſuits had no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the conſequences drawn from their principles: from whence it was concluded; <hi>That a Doctor may turn and overturn men's conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as he thinks fit, and make new rules of Morals: that by this means a Chriſtian may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange himſelf without fear of puniſhment, from the rules preſcrib'd us, by the Scripture, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:174113:54"/>
               <p>Althô <hi>Layman</hi> ſhou'd have ſayd no more than this, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> interrupting him, <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok's</hi> arguments wou'd have prov'd but weak and ſilly: for by giving this Doctor, as <hi>Layman</hi> has done, the quality of an honeſt and a learned man, it is clear, that, morally ſpeaking, he wou'd not have gone aſtray in his deciſions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the doctrin of the Scripture, or the Church. One ought to preſume that he, who is learned, cannot be ignorant of this doctrin; and that he, who is a man of probity, wou'd not corrupt it: and if, of my ſelf, I am not capable to judge of the matter, ſuppoſing he has theſe two qualities, I act prudently in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his deciſion.</p>
               <p>This is the very reflexion, reply'd the Abbot, that <hi>Layman</hi> made, and that <hi>Wendrok</hi> ſhou'd have made when he read him.
<note place="margin">Layman ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>It is nevertheleſs neceſſary,</hi> adds <hi>Layman, that this Doctor ſhou'd not have taken up this opinion raſhly, or inconſideratly, but after weighing and examining the reaſons for the contrary opinion, and this is, what others, and eſpecially thoſe who are unlearned ought commonly to ſuppoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hold, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> I have here the caſe of conſcience of Mr. <hi>Sainte-Beuve;</hi> who, if I well remember, ſayd expreſly, that regularly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and without having a particular reaſon to do otherwiſe, a man ought, without doubting or heſitation, to follow the deciſion of a perſon of this character. It is in the firſt tome, pag. 517, and the 169 caſe. Where this queſtion is put; <hi>Whether one runs the hazard of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:174113:54"/>his Salvation by depending upon the judgment of a learned and a pious man:</hi> which he thus anſwers. <hi>That one may with a ſafe conſcience, ſtick to the reſolutions of a man, known to be learned and pious; unleſs he have ſome particular reaſon to doubt the truth of his deciſions.</hi> I will mark this paſſage, adds he, that I may ſome time or other ſhew it to Mr. <hi>Nicole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Layman</hi> ſtops not there, continu'd the Abbot: for ſee what he adds, for thoſe that are capable of judging the opinions of Caſuiſts. <q>But one ought not, ſayd he, to call that, a probable opinion, which one or more Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have invented, contrary to the common opinion; and which others, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have unanimouſly rejected, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable and particular opinion; induc'd thereunto by good reaſons, or by the decrees of the higher powers, which the firſt either had not heeded, or cou'd not ſolidly anſwer. One may ſee what Saint <hi>Thomas, Sylveſter</hi> and <hi>Navar</hi> ſay upon this point.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the ſecond place I ſay, that an opinion is probable, when it is ſupported by ſuch a ſtrong reaſon, as is perſuaſive enuff to make it to be believ'd, conformable to truth; and this is to be underſtood in reference to a learned man, who underſtands the matter, and has well weigh'd and conſider'd the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the contrary opinion, (thô by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commonly receiv'd) and fully refuted them. <hi>Vaſquez, Sanchez,</hi> and <hi>Azor..</hi>... do teach this doctrin. But, notwithſtanding, it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:174113:55"/>muſt be limited and reſtrain'd by this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that other Doctors, coming afterwards to examin this particular opinion, ſhou'd not look upon it, as improbable, and an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious opinion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> nothing can be wiſer, better circumſcrib'd, or more reſtrain'd than this: and with theſe conditions I ſee no manner of danger in this propoſition. <hi>That the authority of one grave Doctor may make an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion probable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not all, anſwer'd the Abbot: before theſe reſtrictions are apply'd to any matter of this kind, which, like all other Moral matters, are ſubject to be abus'd, and as ſubject alſo to contempt, as to calumny, becauſe it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have regard to a thouſand little nice cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the omiſſion, or addition of any one of which, is, ſometimes, ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this doctrin odious: before all this, I ſay, <hi>Layman,</hi> at the beginning of the ſame page, had layd down this principle.</p>

               <p>I leave you to think, continu'd the Abbot, if a probable opinion, which according to the Jeſuits, ceaſes to be probable, and becomes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, as ſoon as it appears contrary, to what we are aſcertain'd of, by faith, can deſtroy
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:174113:55"/>the Morals of the Scripture, the Fathers and the Church: or, if the principles, and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a probable opinion, from which <hi>Paſcal</hi> draws ſo many fine conſequences, are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and definitions of the Jeſuits: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Wendrok</hi> ought to have choſen <hi>Laymans's</hi> doctrin, for an example of looſe Morals in this kind; or to ſhew, that theſe Fathers had no reaſon to complain of <hi>Paſcal's</hi> unfaithfulneſs, in reporting their opinions: for, even in the two lines, which he cites, mangled and disjoynted as they are, there is enuff to juſtify this Divine, and to refute all the ridiculous concluſions he ſets down, as natural conſequences of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. At the ſame time <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> read <hi>Wendrok's</hi> note upon the place, and being ſurpriz'd at his impudence and falſhood, cou'd not forbear ſhrugging up their ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>The other quotations are ſhorter, ſayd the Abbot: who immediatly read them the paſſage in <hi>Suarez;</hi> where this Divine requires two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, for the making an opinion probable.
<note place="margin">Suarez tract. 3. in 1.2. diſp. 12. ſect. 5.</note> 
                  <q>The firſt, that it be not repugnant to the authorities receiv'd in the Church, nor to any evident reaſon; and that it be not raſhly taken up, contrary to the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary opinions of Doctors. The ſecond, that it be built, upon ſome certain and ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now ſee what <hi>Azor,</hi> another Jeſuit, ſays, concerning the choice a man ought to make of opinions. <q>One may conſider them, ſays he, two ways: either with reference to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:174113:56"/>the <hi>exterior court,</hi> or with reference to the <hi>interior court</hi> of conſcience. I will firſt ſpeak of the choice one ought to make of opinions in the exterior court; and I will afterwards explain, what opinion one ought to follow in the interior court of conſcience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The firſt rule is, that, from the moment there is any judgment, or definition of faith made, in clear and expreſs terms, whatever may be ſayd to the contrary, by the graveſt Doctors, the opinion that is founded upon this judgment, or definition of faith, or comes neareſt to it, is to be held altogether true and certain, without giving themſelves any trouble, on account of thoſe Doctors opinions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That is very poſitive, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and this rule ſecures the doctrin of faith, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the Goſpel. But obſerve, that according to your text, this Jeſuit ſpeaks there of the choice of opinions in the <hi>exterior court;</hi> and the main queſtion between us is, about the choice of opinions in the <hi>interior court</hi> of conſcience.</p>
               <p>A little patience, and you ſhall ſoon be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, anſwer'd the Abbot. After <hi>Azor</hi> had ſet down ſeveral other rules concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior court, in the beginning of the ſixteenth chapter he thus ſpeaks. <q>Let us now ſee, in a few words, what opinion one may chooſe in the interior court of conſcience: it is firſt demanded, whether the rules given from the ninth to the thirteenth chapter, ought alſo to be obſerv'd in the court of conſcience; and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:174113:56"/>anſwer'd; the three firſt, to wit, thoſe ſet down in the ninth, tenth and eleventh are to be kept in the court of conſcience alſo; becauſe they there take place, and are as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as in the <hi>exterior court,</hi> which is a thing clear of it ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The rule that I have now read you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Abbot, is the firſt in the ninth chapter. Let us read <hi>Filiucius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is one of the four and twenty old men, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> laughing.</p>
               <p>Yes, anſwer'd the Abbot, and one of thoſe, to whom <hi>Paſcal</hi> do's the honor to name and quote, to prove the diſorders which follow the doctrin of probable opinions: however, let us read what he ſays upon the matter before us.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It thence follows, that to the end,
<note place="margin">Filiucius tract. 1. de Decal. cap. 4. num. 163.</note> an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be probable, it muſt be generally eſteem'd to contain nothing erronious, nor to be contrary to any Canon, or Decree of Superiors.</q>
                  <note place="margin">Reginald. lib. 13. cap. 2. num. 103.</note> Let us alſo look upon <hi>Reginaldus</hi> who do's but tranſcribe <hi>Azor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already ſeen enuff on this point, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> but I wou'd be glad to know, whether the Jeſuits have tranſgreſs'd the bounds preſcrib'd by themſelves.</p>
               <p>Hold; we are not yet come ſo far, ſayd the Abbot interrupting him in ſome anger: and before we get thither, you muſt own, that your <hi>Paſcal,</hi> and his ſecond, have made the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo; when ſeeming to explain the doctrin of the Jeſuits, which they rather ought to have call'd, the doctrin of all Catholic Divines, who
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:174113:57"/>till then had written upon this ſubject, they conceal all the modifications and reſtrictions of this doctrin, on purpoſe, that they might draw from it, moſt dreadful conſequences; which they not only do, but alſo have the impudence to aſſert, that by the doctrin of probabilites, and by the latitude the Society gives to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinions, they have baniſh'd out of Moral Divinity the Goſpel and the Canons, to ſubſtitute in their place, the new notions and ideas of the Schools of theſe times.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits had in general defin'd, a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, <hi>An opinion back'd, and ſupported by conſiderable authority, or by ſome important reaſon, againſt which there was nothing convincing to be offer'd.</hi> And, as if they had been Heathens, who did not reckon the authority of Scripture and the Councils in the number of convincing things, they reproach'd them, as if they had not made the Scripture, the Councils or the Fathers the rule of their deciſions, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd mens conſciences by caprice, by wild and extravagant fancies, and the vain ſubtilties of their Doctors.</p>
               <p>Yes, I dare ſay it, continu'd the Abbot ſomewhat incens'd, and I will juſtify it too: that, according to the common, ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Jeſuit Divines (out of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I except ſome few Compilers, and ſome Abridgers, who have another end than the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themſelves whom they abridge) there is not one deciſion, of any caſe of conſcience, that can have the Scripture, the Councils and the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:174113:57"/>Fathers for a rule, where theſe ſort of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not lead the Van, or are not firſt to be ſeen before all others: or where the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture, the Canons of Councils, the Decretals of Popes, and the Civil Law, when pertinent to the point, do not make their main eſſential proofs, or at leaſt the ſubject of their diſſertations, when under any difficulty; and that never any authors went further, or waded deeper in the pure ſprings and fountains of Morals, than the principal Jeſuit Divines. Witneſs <hi>Azor, Suarez, Vaſquez, Layman, Leſſius,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Sanchez.</hi> You need but open their books, to ſhew the falſhood and the vanity of all theſe fooliſh impoſtures; of which there is no other proof, than the ſayings and invectives of their calumniating Adverſaries</p>
               <p>There is ſome pleaſure Mr. Abbot in angring of you, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> laughing: and it is the Jeſuits intereſt, that we ſhou'd ſometimes provoke you: you have told us wonders. And I cannot but own my ſelf convinc'd, that, in reality, things have been outragiouſly exagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: that the author of the Provincial Letters has run too faſt, and that the good ſimple Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, who ſpeaks in them, had no Letter of Atturny, no authority, from the Society, to ſay and grant all the impertinences, which <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> has put into his mouth.</p>
               <p>That is not a ſufficient ſatisfaction for Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> he wou'd have things call'd by their proper names, a ſpade a ſpade: you agreed with him a little while ago, that it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:174113:58"/>was a meer calumny, to impute to the Jeſuits, as a crime, their teaching a doctrin, that had been taught by all the Biſhops, who treated of that ſubject, and before they were in being, by all the Profeſſors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> who have printed any books of Divinity, by the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> the <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> the Univerſity of <hi>Louvain,</hi> and almoſt by all Divines. He alſo pretends, that it was yet a greater piece of malice, to disfigure and miſrepreſent this doctrin; to have given ſuch a falſe and horrible idea of it; and to have lam'd, or falily interpreted the definitions, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but that they might draw from them the moſt dreadful conſequences imaginable. You call this to exaggerate, and he pretends that it is to corrupt, to poyſon, to ly and to calumniat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot, anſwerds <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him: this is but a diſpute about words. We both think the ſame thing, and ſo do's <hi>Cleander</hi> too: this ought therefore to ſatisfy you, and encourage you, to communicat, what you far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know in this matter, ſince you ſee we have profited ſo well by what you have already told us.</p>
               <p>I might yet make you a great many remarks upon this ſubject, ſayd the Abbot: but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, that I have much ado to hold, when I ſee <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wendrok</hi> treat, unworthily and unhandſomly, upon this occaſion, under the name of Caſuiſts, ſo great a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, famous for their learning, and for their vertue, honored in their time, and reſpected
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:174113:58"/>by the moſt eminent, and the moſt holy men, that were in the Church of God. In vain, to make themſelves leſs odious and better believ'd, do they pretend to have no deſign, but againſt the Jeſuits, whoſe deſtruction they aim'd at, and againſt a few others, whom they were not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to treat with reſpect.

                  <hi>In this cloud of Caſuiſts,</hi> as <hi>Wendrok</hi> expreſſes it, and inſolently compares them to that multitude of frogs, which cover'd <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when <hi>Pharao</hi> was King, of whom the Jeſuits were but the ſmalleſt number, and to whom the paths were beaten out, by perſons, whoſe character in the Church was always ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable to all true Catholics: I mean, the moſt learned Biſhops of their time, the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Doctors, and the moſt famous Canoniſts: among whom is to be ſeen Saint <hi>Antonin</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Florence;</hi> who, in the point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, is juſt of the ſame opinion with others, notwithſtanding all the falſhoods <hi>Wendrok</hi> is guilty of in this article, which ſo much diſturbs and confounds him; and all the artifices he makes uſe of, to diſguiſe the contempt he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has, and which he wou'd have others have, of this holy Divine.</p>
               <p>And if ſome Jeſuits, as <hi>Suarez, Vaſquez, Sanchez, Leſſius,</hi> &amp;c. are ſometimes quoted in the writings of Divines, together with other eminent men, it is not, becauſe that in their books, <hi>There is neither piety nor learning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wendrok loco cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. §. 1.</note> as they have impudently given out, but becauſe, that piety and learning are joyn'd with as much clearneſs, ſolidity and order, as in the works of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:174113:59"/>the moſt able Doctors. But for this, we muſt not take either <hi>Paſcals</hi> or <hi>Wendrok's</hi> words, nor theirs, who have not read the works of theſe Jeſuit Divines; but we may be aſſur'd, that the moſt learned, and moſt ſound part of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> Profeſſors will own this truth; and that it will alſo be acknowledg'd, by all thoſe of <hi>Louvain,</hi> except the Diſciples of <hi>Baius</hi> and <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius:</hi> by the moſt learned Prelats of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the grave experienc'd Penitentiarys or Confeſſors, who to their great advantage, have frequent recourſe to them; and by the Popes, who have given great elogiums and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſeveral of them. But we may in the laſt place refer our ſelves, to the teſtimonies, formerly given, by their own Body, of their vertue and their ſanctity; teſtimonies ſo much the leſs to be ſuſpected, that no body then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, or cou'd gueſs, that Doctors ſo Catholic, and commonly ſo exact, and ſo ſolid as theſe, ſhou'd ever be attack'd for the corrupters of Morals by a <hi>Paſcal,</hi> or a <hi>Wendrok.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I pray you, continued the Abbot, let us quite lay aſide all prejudices, and impartially conſider, what is this <hi>Paſcal</hi> and what is this <hi>Wendrok,</hi> in the matters we are now upon. <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok</hi> has publiſh'd ſome Moral Eſſays, <hi>Paſcal</hi> underſtood ſome parts of Mathematics, and was polite. Theſe two, oppoſe, in the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory tone, the Fathers, to the Morals of the Jeſuits, to the deciſions of the Church, and to the determinations of the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> The firſt had never ſeen, or read the Fathers, but with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:174113:59"/>the eyes of the chief of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is ſo very weak, that he is really to be pitied, when he offers at any point of Divinity. The firſt wins upon his readers, only by his talent of buffoonry, of jeſting and fooling: the ſecond impoſes upon ſome, by his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and his boldneſs: but, indeed, it is ſtrange he ſhou'd be able to impoſe upon any, conſidering that he never, almoſt, expreſſes himſelf, but like a furious mad-man.</p>
               <p>They endeavor to make Religious Saints, whoſe piety was never before ſuſpected by any perſon, paſs for wicked and ungodly men; and to have learned men, who always had a great and equal reputation for wiſdom and learning, and who ſolemly profeſs to follow no other doctrin, but that which is commonly taught, in all Catholic Schools, to be reputed whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and extravagant. Theſe two witneſſes, who ſwear againſt them, were the forlorn hope of a revolted party againſt the Church, ſent out, by Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> to fall foul upon the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> and the Jeſuits. They bring down ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral paſſages, out of ſeveral books and ſeveral authors: they order and diſpoſe them as they think beſt for their purpoſe: they mix them here and there with their own reflexions, and with the impertinences which they make a very od man ſpeak, brought upon the ſtage, for that very purpoſe; and, of all together, they compoſe a horrible, friteful, piece of work: whereas the greateſt part of theſe paſſages, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back to the places from whence they were
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:174113:60"/>taken, and joyn'd, to the aſſertions from which they were divided; taken and underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reſtrictions and modifications there ſet down, have, commonly, nothing but what is wiſe and agreeable to ſenſe and reaſon, nor any thing, but what is conformable to the principles of ſound Morals. I ſay, commonly, becauſe, none yet are ſo fooliſh, as to pretend, that the Jeſuits have more of the gift of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, than other Divines, or than even the Fathers themſelves have had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> interrupting him, if you can give us as good an account of theſe paſſages, and theſe particular matters of fact, as you have done of thoſe we have been upon to day, we ſhall be of your ſide; and hiſs and laugh at the author of the <hi>Parallele des Anciens &amp; des Modernes,</hi> for his article of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Letters.</p>
               <p>That I will do when you pleaſe, anſwer'd the Abbot. But I was inſenſibly the cauſe of a long digreſſion about matters of fact, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which you had, perhaps, no deſign to buſy your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters of fact, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> are in this affair eſſential; and ſufficient to defend the Jeſuits, and condem their adverſaries: nor are they altogether unuſeful towards judging and deciding the diſpute and matter of law. You made me take notice, as we went along, of ſome things, which perſuade me, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you, that it is not ſo eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin or be poſitive in this matter, as it is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:174113:60"/>generally thought; and really the more I have of late examin'd it, the more difficulty have I found to chooſe what ſide I wou'd be of.</p>
               <p>I am my ſelf, almoſt, as unreſolv'd as you; ſayd the Abbot. I am convinc'd of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood of ſome articles, but in ſuſpence for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The next time we meet, He tell you all I know, and all I think, and then leave you to judge.</p>
               <p>The converſation about probable opinions went no farther; but they diſcours'd for ſome time after of the Provincial Letters. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, who is very quick and ſagacious, and knows, perfectly well, how to diſtinguiſh, in any book between what is real and ſolid; and what is glittering and ſhewiſh: and between ſome rambling extravagant maxims, by which men daily ſupply the want of reaſon and juſtice, in the cauſe, they defend; made his two friends ſeveral important reflexions.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, he made them quickly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that there never came out any book, that ought more to be diſtruſted than the Provincial Letters; whether one regarded the fource, from whence this work was deriv'd, or the occaſion of it's being made, or the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires which were follow'd, or the manner wherein it was compos'd, or that, wherein it was publiſh'd, or the judgment of thoſe, who examin'd it, and whoſe duty it was to examin it to the bottom. And alſo plainly ſhew'd them, that this book was made by men, who were then, at leaſt, ſuſpected in matters of faith:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:174113:61"/>that the <hi>Sorbonne's</hi> cenſuring Mr. <hi>Arnauld's</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, was the occaſion of it: that the <hi>Paris</hi> Divines, and their doctrin, in a point they judg'd eſſential, to juſtify the deciſions of the Church, was in it turn'd to ridicule, and their aſſemblies, repreſented as ſo many farces and interludes of merriment and foolery, without any reſpect, for the moſt illuſtrious perſons of the Kingdom, who by the King's command made a part of them: and, laſtly, that theſe Letters were but a kind of comedy to entertain people at the expence of the Jeſuits, becauſe they were believ'd to have contributed moſt to the condemnation of <hi>Janſenius's</hi> five propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, he made it appear, that there never was a book, wherein ſome general and ſpecious maxims were more abus'd; max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, that were proper to ſurpriſe either ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial or lazy men, who wou'd not take the pains to examin whether their application was either juſt or ſincere: that it was therein all along ſayd, that Chriſtians cou'd have no other rule of Morals, but the Scripture, the Fathers, and the Councils; and that the fancys, or imaginations of modern authors, if it were but for their novelty, ought to be accounted and paſs for dangerous.</p>
               <p>The Abbot enlarg'd himſelf, fully, upon this article, which he excellently well clear'd from all objections and difficulties. I wou'd be glad to know, ſayd he, for example, how a Curat, who had got all the Bible by heart, and had
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:174113:61"/>alſo got into his head the ſeventeen tomes of the laſt edition of the Councils, together with all Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and the reſt of the Greek and Latin Fathers, but had never read any one of the Caſuiſts; how, I ſay, cou'd this Curat take upon him, to hear Confeſſions, and reſolve all the caſes of Conſcience, which his Pariſhoners might propoſe to him: or whether he cou'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, from the works of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> or from thoſe of Saint <hi>Proſper,</hi> how to determin all the difficulties, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the impediments of matrimony; how to diſtinguiſh, between that, which makes it nul, and that, which renders it only unlawful: or, how cou'd he there find all the expedients he ought to make uſe of, in theſe matters, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſcandal, diviſions, quarrels and deſtruction of families? what might, or ought to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or permitted, or hinder'd in regard to certain, nice, and tender circumſtances and conjunctures? how this Curat, whether in City, or in Country, cou'd be able to anſwer about the validity, or the nullity, the juſtice, or injuſtice of ſome contracts, and about the doubts, which a thouſand different circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may occaſion, even in ſuch contracts as are leaſt diſputed? how ſhou'd he behave himſelf, in matters of reſtitution? wherein one rule, whether it be of the law of nature, or of the poſitive law, often ſeems to deſtroy another. How many difficulties, in matter of cenſures, irregularities, and diſpenſations, do daily ariſe,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:174113:62"/>which the Councils cou'd neither foreſee, nor regulate, and of which experience, only, gain'd by hearing Confeſſions, gave occaſion to treat, to clear, and decide them? a man may, almoſt, ſay the ſame things of every part of Morals; the Divine law, which is compris'd in the holy Scripture, and the Eccleſiaſtic law, which is compris'd in the Councils, are they not alſo, as well as the Civil law, the inſtruments God makes uſe of, to regulat the manners, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and the differences of men? and are they not likewiſe, at the ſame time, the ſources, and ſprings, of an infinit number of difficulties and troubles? having theſe holy rules, ſay our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, what need have we of Caſuiſts, and of all their great volumes, which fill whole libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? and, I demand of them, ſince there are ſo many and ſo good laws, why are there ſuch a number of Lawyers in the world, and ſo many commentaries upon thoſe laws? and why, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, are there ſtill ſo many ſuites, wherein the Judges, who beſt underſtand all theſe laws, and all theſe commentaries, are, ſometimes, hard put to it, much imbarraſs'd and perplex'd in giving their Judgments?</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares to all peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, that they are oblig'd in confeſſion to tell the number of their ſins, and their different kinds: the Confeſſors are oblig'd to explain to them thoſe different kinds, to know them, and to make a judgment of them: are the means of doing all this exactly and prudently, which go very far and ſuppoſe no ſmall skill in ſeveral
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:174113:62"/>ſorts of learning, in School Divinity, in Moral Divinity, and even in Logic, to be found in the Scriptures, in the Councils, or in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? and without reducing things to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that theſe Divines, ſo much deſpis'd, have done, into how many ſcruples, and difficulties wou'd this decree of the Council put both the penitents and the Confeſſors?</p>
               <p>No, no, one muſt not oppoſe the doctrin of the Scriptures, the Fathers, and the Councils, to the doctrin of Divines, and the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Caſuiſts; no more then they muſt the Commentators and interpreters of the laws, to the laws themſelves. One may indeed examin, whether their conſequences are well or ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; or whether the Fathers, in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and in thoſe particular caſes, wou'd have decided as they did: or whether, they ſwerv'd from the right way, or went aſtray by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by wilfulneſs, or by malice. The Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic Superiors have a right, to provide and take care in this matter: but it is alſo the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian readers duty, and they are in charity bound to it, not to believe <hi>Paſcal</hi> upon his own word, nor truſt his extracts, even when he quotes the books, the chapters, and the pages: the reſpect due to the perſons he attacks, is a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt him: and the judgment any one ſhou'd make, upon his teſtimony or aſſertion, wou'd certainly be too raſh and too fooliſh. The moſt men ought to do, when they read him, is but to doubt, whether as declar'd an enemy as he is, he may not, poſſibly ſpeak
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:174113:63"/>truth: but not to conclude all thoſe guilty, whom he condems, and for no other reaſon, but becauſe he is pleas'd to ſay, they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Church learning, occaſions of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to Chriſtianity, the corrupters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Morals of our Savior; and that as ſoon as they appear'd, they baniſh'd the Scriptures, the Councils, and the Fathers.</p>
               <p>I am as much perſuaded as you, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that this Curat, you ſpeak of, with all his knowledge in Scripture, Councils, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wou'd be often very much puzzled how to ſolve all his Pariſhoners difficulties, whether put to him, in Confeſſions, or in conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if he had not ſome ſpecial and particular rule to aſſiſt him, in the application of thoſe general rules: and his fate wou'd be the ſame with ſome Lawyers, who have the Inſtitutes, the Code, and the digeſts almoſt by heart, and yet are not able to adviſe, or counſel aright one of their farmers, or tenants in a ſuit againſt his neighbor, about the bounds of his lands, his cloſe, or fields, I know more than one Curat, or one Doctor, who declaim and thunder out aloud againſt the Jeſuits Morals, and yet, in their cloſets, Cardinal <hi>Lugo, Leſſius, Sanchez, Layman</hi> and <hi>Azor</hi> are the advocats they conſult, and by whoſe determinations they often gain a great deal of honor.</p>
               <p>You are in the right, replied the Abbot, and it is without doubt for this reaſon, that Saint <hi>Charles Borromeus,</hi> in a little treatiſe he has made about true Confeſſion, do's expreſly injoyn his

               <p>Saint <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> ſhews he was of the ſame opinion, in a little piece which he directs to his Prieſts, intitled,

               <p>You there touch upon a point of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> and without all doubt, the authority and teſtimony of Saint <hi>Charles Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeus,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales,</hi> ought not to be of leſs weight, than that of <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Nicole.</hi> And if we add to this, anſwer'd the Abbot,
<note place="margin">The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Meaux</note> that one of our moſt famous Biſhops, in his Synodal, or Dioceſan Statuts, has very lately mention'd among other books which he advis'd his Clergy to read, the better to enable them to hear Confeſſions, <hi>Tolet</hi> and <hi>Azor,</hi> both Jeſuits, the laſt of whom had the honor to be one of <hi>Paſcals</hi> heroes of the looſe Morals, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Jeſuits may have occaſion to flatter themſelves into a belief, that all the world do not blindly run into his opinion or ſuffer themſelves to be deluded, or trapand into <hi>Port-Royal</hi> nets.</p>
               <p>As the Abbot was going on with the Jeſuits Apology, for which he was furniſh'd with very good memoires, <hi>Eudoxus</hi> was call'd away by a letter of conſequence which requir'd an immediat anſwer. But <hi>Cleander</hi> made the Abbot promiſe he wou'd be preſent and make one at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſcourſes which <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and he reſolv'd to have about the Provincial Letters.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:174113:64"/>And likewiſe promis'd, if that appear'd true, they wou'd without difficulty forgive his calling them both impoſtors and calumniators: and that they wou'd afterwards go on, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the particular paſſages, which, the Jeſuits publicly ſay, were, for the moſt part, maim'd, or falſified, or wrongfully tranſpos'd: after which the Abbot and <hi>Cleander</hi> took their leaves of one another, and parted.</p>

               <p>THE Abbot came the next day, at the hour appointed, to take up <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander,</hi> whom he carried to the Fathers of **** whoſe library, he knew, was very well furniſh'd with the books they wanted. There he made a new conqueſt in favor of truth: it was over a young Batchelor of quality of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander's</hi> acquaintance, who, by chance, happen'd to be in the library: and who, having ſaluted them, and underſtood the occaſion of their coming, cou'd not forbear laughing: he ask'd them how they came, at this time of day, to have any ſcruples about a matter, that for ſo many years paſt no body had queſtion'd. To make a doubt, ſayd he, whether the doctrin of probable opinions be the ſpecific doctrin of the Society, of which the Jeſuits were the inventors, and the only, or, almoſt, the only defenders, having of their ſide but a <hi>Caramuel,</hi> or a <hi>Diana,</hi> at moſt, is to doubt, whether there be ſuch a City as <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:174113:65"/>in the world, or a Grand Vizir in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Abbot ſpoke, and told him, that in ſuch matters as theſe, there was nothing better, than for a man to ſee things with his own eyes; and that he wou'd do them a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to help them to find out, what might, at laſt, confound a Jeſuit, whoſe confidence the Public had a long time ſuffer'd to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd: that this Jeſuit had been ſo bold, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty years ſince, as to make all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders, a number of Biſhops, the moſt famous Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> and even the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> in the ſight of her own Doctors, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices of the extravagancies of the Society, in matter of Morals: that this was done, by a book licens'd and printed at <hi>Paris:</hi> wherein, without entring into the matter of Right, or examining, whether the doctrin of probability be good or bad, he confines himſelf to the matter of Fact, that for near a hundred years, and until the year 1660, when his book was printed, this doctrin was the common opinion of all the Biſhops, all the Orders, all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and all the Doctors: that for one, that had oppos'd it, he cou'd eaſily reckon ten, that had defended it: and that, of the three or four, at moſt, who had quitted it in ſome points, two were Jeſuits. You ſee what his paradox is, added the Abbot, ſeeming to ſpeak very ſeriouſly. And this author, continued he, to put his deſign in execution the more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, has reduc'd the whole doctrin of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:174113:65"/>to two propoſitions, which in effect contain it wholy: the firſt: <hi>That, of two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinions, one may follow the leſs ſafe.</hi> The ſecond: <hi>That, of two probable opinions, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſollow the leſs probable.</hi> The two Monſters which <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wendrok</hi> have fought with, as ſprung from the damnable politics of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits: and in this little book (which at the ſame time he drew out of his pocket) 'tis bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay, affirm'd, that theſe two propoſitions were taught, either ſeparatly, or both together, by this croud of non-Jeſuit Divines, which are all nam'd, and their paſſages quoted. What inſolence is this if it be not true?</p>
               <p>The young Batcheler, after he had, for ſome time, railly'd at the Jeſuits pretention with <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who affected to ſeem as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous as he, ſayd, he wou'd willingly ſhare in the unneceſſary trouble the Abbot had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to give himſelf. Hereupon they fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to work, to the turning over the books, which the library keeper put into their hands, as faſt as they call'd for them: they follow'd the order of the chapters, and begun with the liſt of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>They preſently read, in Saint <hi>Antonin,</hi> the firſt propoſition, expreſs'd in theſe words. <hi>Eligere viam tutiorem conſilij eſt, non praecepti. To chooſe the ſafer way, is matter of counſel not command.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Wendrok,</hi> who was gravel'd at this paſſage, had anſwer'd, that Saint <hi>Antonin</hi> ſpoke there, only of the choice of conditions, or ſtates of life, and that he meant no more than
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:174113:66"/>this, that thô it were ſafer to become Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than to live in the world, it was, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not a command to become Religious, but only an advice: they read what the Jeſuit Author had writ upon that text, to refute <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok's</hi> explication. This Saint ſpeaks there of an action, of which there is a doubt whether it be a ſin or not a ſin, which in reality is the ground of the queſtion treated of, in this whole paragraph. Here are Saint <hi>Antonin's</hi> own words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is ſayd in the third chapter of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 p. tit. 3. §. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>He that expoſes himſelf to danger, ſhall periſh therein:</hi> from whence Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and others do infer, that he, who do's an action of which he doubts whether it be a mortal ſin or not, do's commit a mortal ſin; becauſe, that thereby he expoſes himſelf to commit a mortal ſin. When therefore in a matter of Morals, there happen to be different and contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he that follows the larger ſeems to expoſe himſelf to the hazard of committing a mortal ſin, it being poſſible, that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be falſe, and the other true.</p>
                  <p>But to this it is anſwer'd, that he, who knowingly do's a thing, wherein he doubts there may be a mortal ſin, do's commit a mortal ſin, if while he do's it, he continues in his doubt, even althô the action, in it ſelf, were not ſinful: and here the word <hi>doubt</hi> is taken in it's moſt ſtrict and proper ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when, becauſe of equal reaſons on both ſides, one do's not incline more to the one than to the other: but when the doubt is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:174113:66"/>light, and but by way of ſcruple, as a man doubts, when ſticking to one opinion, in a matter wherein he is afraid the oppoſit opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be the true opinion; by acting with this doubt he do's not ſin, when he follows the opinion of ſome Doctor, and that there are probable reaſons for this opinion, more than for the contrary, althô the opinion, which is follow'd, ſhou'd be falſe, provided, that it be not againſt the manifeſt authority of the Scripture, or the determinations of the Church. And the reaſon of this is, that he who acts in this manner, do's not act, with the doubt of a mortal ſin, but in his action is guided by a probable opinion.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Batcheler cou'd not eaſily agree to this doctrin, or comprehend how a man cou'd act with a doubt, and yet not offend God. The Abbot ſayd, that, according to the principles of Saint <hi>Antonin,</hi> and thoſe Divines who follow'd him, one muſt, in this matter, diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>practical</hi> and a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> doubt: that they hold, that the one do's not neceſſarily follow the other, and that one may act with a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> doubt, althô it be not lawful to act with a <hi>practical</hi> doubt. But in a word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, the queſtion here, is not of the Right, but of the Fact; nor whether Saint <hi>Antonin</hi> was in the right, or in the wrong; but only, whether the Jeſuits do fully prove, that his opinion was the ſame with theirs.</p>
               <p>At leaſt, anſwer'd the Batcheler, Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonin</hi> ſeems to ſay, that in allowing the leſs ſafe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:174113:67"/>to be follow'd, one is oblig'd to follow the more probable opinion.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuit, reply'd the Abbot pretends to no more: his drift is, only, to ſhew that Saint, <hi>Antonin</hi> held, at leaſt, that one might follow an opinion which is but probable; and that, of two probable opinions, one may follow the leſs ſafe; althô there ſhou'd be ſtill danger, that it might be falſe. If we were to diſpute the thing, we ſhou'd, by this ſingle principle of Saint <hi>Antonin,</hi> overturn all <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wendrok's</hi> Divinity on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>The next, they call'd for, was <hi>Didacus Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> that man, ſo famous for his diſpute <hi>de Auxilijs,</hi> when <hi>Dominican,</hi> and who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Archbiſhop of <hi>Trani,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> They look'd for the title of the diſpute 80 to wit.
<note place="margin">Ad. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether, of two probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, a man may follow that which he ſhall judge moſt convenient, and leave even that which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the more probable.</hi> This Divine, after he had brought down the opinion of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and of ſome other <hi>Thomists,</hi> which ſeem to hold that one ought to follow the more probable, ſpeaks thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond opinion is contrary to this,
<note place="margin">Num. 4.</note> and holds that every body may follow that opinion, which he judges probable. This is held by Maſter <hi>Medina,</hi> and with him by many other learned <hi>Thomiſts.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, he ſets down a third, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the two others, by the reſtrictions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it allows the leſs probable opinion to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:174113:67"/>follow'd, which are, that neither our neighbor, nor our Religion be concern'd therein, and that there be not in it, any particular circumſtances, to offend the honor of God: he alſo adds ſome ſuppoſitions. Firſt he lays down as a thing not to be doubted of, that, when two opinions are equally probable, or, that there is very little difference in the point of probability, one may chooſe which of the two he pleaſes: ſecondly, that when a penitent has follow'd a probable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, for example, that which ſays, ſuch or ſuch a contract is lawful, his Confeſſor ought to abſolve him, althô he ſhou'd believe it more probable, and even certain, that the contract is unlawful: <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the penitent, in following this probable opinion, has not ſinned.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 9.</note> After which he declares himſelf of this third opinion, and anſwers the arguments of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> which, for the moſt part, do only prove, that one ought to make uſe of the foremention'd reſtrictions, and which all the Jeſuits, who taught this doctrin never fail'd to preſcribe. Upon which the Abbot in a few words made theſe two reflexions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that nothing can be more clearly taught, than that, on ſeveral occaſions, <hi>It is lawful to follow the leſs probable opinion, althô that, at the ſame time, it ſhou'd be the leſs ſafe.</hi> And in the ſecond place, that the ſingle teſtimony of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> may ſave them the labor, of turning over <hi>Medina, and the other learned Thomiſts;</hi> to ſatisfy themſelves that the doctrin which was attributed only to the Jeſuits was common to them with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:174113:68"/>the moſt able Divines of Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> School.</p>
               <p>Theſe reflexions, which began to put the Batcheler a little out of countenance, made <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> ſmile, who, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day's diſcourſe, were prevented from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurpriz'd, as he was, at the things that were ſhewn them.</p>
               <p>The Abbot went on, and ſhew'd the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſition in

Beſides, perhaps, he extended this matter too far. But without regarding his opinion, may we not, at leaſt, hear him as a witneſs of a matter of fact, wherein he was very well vers'd. This opinion, ſays he,
<note place="margin">Num. 302.</note> here in his Moral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which he dedicated to <hi>Alexander</hi> VII, is, at this time, the common opinion of all the world, that men may, with a ſafe conſcience, follow the leſs probable opinion. <hi>The common opinion,</hi> adds he, <hi>is, that it is lawful to follow the leſs probable and the leſs ſafe opinion, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the more probable and the more ſafe opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See now, continued the Abbot, eight Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, beſides <hi>Caramuel,</hi> all men particularly diſtinguiſh'd, and remarkable for their learning and their piety, who hold the firſt part of the doctrin of probability, and ſeven, that hold the whole, pure and intire. What an honor is this for the Jeſuits, that all theſe learned men are accounted as nothing in reſpect of them? and that, in a common cauſe, they ſhou'd be regarded as the chief, who alone deſerve to be attack'd, and that all theſe Prelats ſhou'd not be thought worth the trouble of being ſo much as nam'd?</p>
               <p>They are in truth Biſhops, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:174113:69"/>laughing, but they are but <hi>Italians, Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Flemings;</hi> and if I were a Batcheler of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> as this Gentleman is, two of their Doctors wou'd weigh more with me, than all thoſe people, who, perhaps, might have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Jeſuits. In that point, ſayd he to the Abbot, it were well, if you cou'd juſtify the quotations of your Father <hi>Dechamps:</hi> as for <hi>Cleander</hi> and me, who are not ſo much concern'd in the matter, we will ſtill go on to make the <hi>Thomists</hi> ready for you.</p>
               <p>The miſchief on't is, ſayd the Abbot, that ſome of theſe had quitted the world before the Jeſuits were come into it: and that others had printed this doctrin, before any Jeſuit had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Divinity. The reſt were either <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> or Doctors of <hi>Louvain,</hi> and appear'd very indifferent for the intereſts, or the doctrin of the Society. But I will willingly refer my ſelf in the matter to the Doctors of <hi>Paris.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they took <hi>Iſambert, Du-val, Gamache</hi> and <hi>Bail,</hi> quoted by Father <hi>Dechamps.</hi> Wherein, were read to the Batcheler theſe plain propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were the day before ſhewn to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander. That one is not oblig'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the more ſafe opinion: and that one may in conſcience follow the leſs ſafe, and leſs probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and quit the more probable and more ſafe opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was very much ſurpris'd, and ſayd he wou'd ſee no more; but how then, added he, comes it to paſs, that all the world ſay it is the peculiar doctrin of the Jeſuits, the ſecret and foundation of their corrupted Morals, and of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:174113:69"/>their Politics? and how happens it, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wendrok,</hi> quitting all others, fall only upon them? and that they ſpeak of theſe Fathers, and of their opinions in this matter, as the ſcandal of Religion, ſaying, that the heretics ought not to judge of the Church's doctrin, by the doctrin of the Jeſuits, and that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Univerſities, the other Communities and Religious Orders do not partake in their errors? you fill my head witha world of ſcruples, ſayd he to <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander;</hi> I my ſelf, upon this account, have a thouſand times exclaim'd againſt, and run down the Society: the matter paſſes for a thing evident and certain by the charity and the care of the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> and is become ſo public, that I did not believe I was guilty, in this, of raſh judgment, nor of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or calumny.</p>
               <p>I am well pleas'd, anſwerd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that you have ſo tender a conſcience: but, after all, is not <hi>Paſcal, Wendrok,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> and all their friends of weight enuff to hinder and ſecure your judgment from being raſh, althô it ſhou'd be falſe? believe me, that if you wou'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden your conſcience of theſe ſins, you ought to go and confeſs them to Mr. Curat of ****, however ſevere he be in other matters, he will not refuſe you abſolution on this account; but let me adviſe you to tell him the caſe with all it's circumſtances: for if you ſpeak to him of raſh judgment, or of detraction, in general, with reference to the doctrin of ſome Divines, he will believe you ſpeak of Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:174113:70"/>of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and that will not be for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Tell him it is of the Jeſuits, and he will comfort you; he will enlarge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as if you had been a weak ſcrupulous perſon; he will inform you, that it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways any great crime to ſpeak little trifling things of one's neighbor; and that, when they happen to be ſayd of the Jeſuits, they may ſometimes have a very good effect.</p>
               <p>The Batcheler hereupon having taken leave of them, they ſtay'd ſometime longer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare many paſſages with the texts of the authors cited, which they found very exact. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be weary of a labor, which was not at all pleaſant or agreeable, they only choſe five or ſix more of the moſt poſitive, to verify them, and eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. They pitch'd upon theſe Divines rather than any others, not only for the reputation their School is in, but alſo becauſe there have been, of late, ſome particular perſons of their Order, very ill inſtructed, without doubt, in the opinions of their Doctors, who affected to make all the inconveniences, real, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, of the doctrin of probable opinions fall upon the Jeſuits alone.</p>
               <p>But before the other paſſages were compar'd, the Abbot deſir'd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> to take notice of what Father <hi>Dechamps</hi> aſſerts in his book,
<note place="margin">Quaeſtio facti.</note> to wit, that the <hi>Dominican</hi> Divines, who had handled this matter for near theſe hundred years, had all agreed, in teaching theſe two propoſitions together. <hi>That one is not oblig'd to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:174113:70"/>follow the more ſafe opinion, and, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to follow the leſs probable and leſs ſafe, and quit the more ſafe and more probable opinion.</hi> 
                  <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, ſays this Father, that I have not found one of thoſe I have read, nor of thoſe quoted by the authors I have read, who has given the leaſt ground to believe, that he was of a contrary opinion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, of all the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> he begun with, was <hi>Bartholemew de Medina,</hi> whom <hi>Antony</hi> of <hi>Siena, in his Bibliotheca,</hi> qualifies with the title of the complete and excellent Divine, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd as much, by his probity and his piety, as by his learning.
<note place="margin">q. 19 a. 6. c. 3.</note> Theſe words are to be ſeen in his commentaries upon Saint <hi>Thomas's prima ſecundae,</hi> printed many years before any Jeſuit had handled this matter. <hi>From thence ariſes a great queſtion, to wit, whether a man be oblig'd to follow the more probable opinion:</hi> and after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the contrary opinion, he thus determins. <hi>My opinion is, that if the opinion be probable, it is lawful to follow it, althô the contrary opinion ſhou'd be more probable:</hi> which he afterwards proves at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleander</hi> having read, among the remaining authors, the name <hi>Dominic Bannes,</hi> deſir'd he might be conſulted: he was, ſayd he, a man of ſome weight and value, and one of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of Saint <hi>Tereſa:</hi> they open'd his works, and found in his treatiſe upon <hi>prima ſecundae</hi> theſe words. <q>There are two ſorts of opinions;
<note place="margin">q. 10. a. 11. dub. 3. c. 4.</note> for ſome relate to actions, for example, to know whether ſuch a contract be lawful or
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:174113:71"/>not. Others concern the things themſelves, to know whether a thing be ſo or ſo: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this houſe belongs to me, or to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I ſay then for the firſt kind, that men may follow a probable opinion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the more probable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this 'tis plain, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that the Holy <hi>Tereſa's</hi> Director is, like the reſt, of the looſe Morals; and for which there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: for the Inquiſition, which bore with this doctrin, wou'd never have ſuffer'd a <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the publication of <hi>Paſcals</hi> Letters. Witneſs, ſayd the Abbot, what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the laſt year. A Religious man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to get the Provincial Letters, tranſlated into <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> to be printed at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that they might, as was ſayd, be ſent into the <hi>Indies;</hi> to give the Chriſtians, there, the ſame kind of character and idea of the Jeſuits, as was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to be given to the Catholics of <hi>France.</hi> But what's worſe than ill luck? the Inquiſition got notice of it, and cited the Religious man; who, being queſtion'd about this new book, found about him, anſwer'd, he knew not what it was: that it was directed to him, without telling him from whence it came. But the printed leaves appearing ſtill freſh, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and ſhut up till farther orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleander</hi> ask'd him if the Jeſuits knew this ſtory? they know it, anſwer'd the Abbot, and wou'd be very glad, they had not ſo much cauſe as they daily have to complain of ſuch kind of proceedings. After this, they read, in the little
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:174113:71"/>book, the reſt of the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> quoted, without taking the pains to ſearch into their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular works, out of which, no doubt, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are moſt faithfully extracted.</p>

<note place="margin">Pag. 182. Controv. 14.</note> had been publiſh'd by order of a General Congregation of the Society. This liſt ended with <hi>Paul Blanchis</hi> and <hi>John Haquet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Abbot further propos'd the juſtifying or proving ſome paſſages of the Doctors of <hi>Louvain,</hi> quoted by Father <hi>Dechamps.</hi> But <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> ſayd they were abundantly ſatisfied. They only took the pains to count the Authors of the other Orders, and the Doctors of all the Univerſities mention'd in the following chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: the number was about threeſcore: but they read, attentively, and with pleaſure, the reflexions made by Father <hi>Dechamps</hi> in the laſt chapter of his little book, which really are very much to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that which the Abbot had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made them, and which, as one may ſay, do's, naturally, preſent it ſelf to their and every body's eyes. To wit; whether there be the leaſt reaſon, or the leaſt equity to attribut to the Jeſuits, as their particular and peculiar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, a doctrin, largely ſpread in the writings of the Divines of all Religious Orders, and of the Doctors of all Catholic Univerſities: and above all, when Mr. <hi>Iſambert</hi> writes in <hi>France,</hi> that it is the common opinion of the Doctors. <hi>Ita communiter Doctores;</hi> that <hi>Bonacina</hi> writes the ſame thing in <hi>Italy: Ita communiter Theologi;</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:174113:72"/>that others ſay it in <hi>Spain,</hi> and others in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. Haec ſententia eſt communis in Scholis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Navar, Io Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram. Ep. Miſienſis.</note> 
                  <hi>Illa ſententia eſt hodie omnium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reflexion is, that, it is yet more ridiculous and more unjuſt, to make the Jeſuits authors of an opinion, taught by ſo many able Doctors before they had a being. <hi>It is the moſt common opinion of Divines,</hi> ſayd <hi>Peter Navar</hi> in the year 1597 <hi>This opinion is ſupported by the greateſt number of Doctors, by the greatest authority, and by the ſtrongeſt reaſons,</hi> ſay'd <hi>Salonius,</hi> an <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in the year 1592.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the Jeſuits have apply'd themſelves, above all other Divines, to limit and reſtrain this doctrin, which certainly may be abus'd more than any other Moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, if it ſhou'd not be taken as it ought to be; and which, in reality, was ſtretch'd too far by ſome Doctors, before it was treated of by the Jeſuits. For this reaſon, <hi>Suarez, Vaſquez, Sanchez,</hi> and other the moſt learned Divines of this Society, have plainly demonſtrated, and convinc'd all the Divines of their time, that this doctrin ought not to take place in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Judges in their Judicatures, nor to Phyſicians in the application of their Medicins, nor to Profeſſors of Divinity, in the choice of the opinions they ought to teach: and theſe laſt, in particular, are bound in conſcience, according to the Morals taught by the Jeſuits, to follow the moſt ſafe opinions in matters of Religion, and ſuch as are conformable to the common practice of the Church, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:174113:73"/>certain in the matter of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the fourth reflexion, which, by the way, they had touch'd upon in the precedent diſcourſe, is, that from the time this doctrin was in vogue till the year 1660 there had been but one Author who attack'd it in it's full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and that this Author was an <hi>Italian</hi> Jeſuit, <hi>Comitolus,</hi> from whom <hi>Wendrok</hi> had taken the beſt part, of what, with any color of reaſon, he had ſayd upon this ſubject, but very diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genouſly, without acquainting his readers that this <hi>Comitalus,</hi> whom he had cited, was a Jeſuit.</p>
               <p>They were going to leave the library, after the Abbot had ſhewn his two friends in the books of ſeveral Jeſuits the definition they give of a probable opinion, together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions added to it, by <hi>Layman, Suarez,</hi> and their other Divines, the extracts of which he had ſhewn the day before: and had thereby made an end of convincing them of <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok's</hi> unfaithfulneſs, who give a very falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make a very wrong ſcheme of this doctrin, to no other end, but that they might have an occaſion to calumniat the Jeſuits. Juſt as <hi>Cleander,</hi> caſting his eyes, by chance, on the 33 page of Father <hi>Dechamps</hi> book, which lay open, ſaw there the name of Father <hi>Morin,</hi> the <hi>Oratorian:</hi> what, ſayd he, laughing aloud, do the Jeſuits bring to their ſuccour, even the very <hi>Oratorians,</hi> upon the chapter of Probability?</p>
               <p>Becauſe that is an extraordinary thing, let us ſee, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> what <hi>Morinus</hi> ſays to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In his eighth book of Penance <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>nu.</hi> 19.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:174113:73"/>theſe words are to be found. <hi>Franciſcus Suarez tra.</hi> 3. <hi>ad</hi> 1.2. <hi>diſp.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. <hi>nu.</hi> 10. <hi>prudenter mihi videtur circumſcribere caſus, in quibus neceſſe eſt opinionem certam praeferre probabili, &amp; probabilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem minus probabili: mihi enim videtur certum &amp; evidens, aliquando probabilia certis praeferri poſſe: quibus igitur indicijs &amp; argumentis haec dignoſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus? quando, ſcilicet, inquit</hi> Suarez, <hi>ex juſtitia vel charitate tenemur vitare damnum, quod re ipſa ſubest, vel periculum ejus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Suarez</hi> ſeems to me to determin very prudently the caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one ought to prefer a certain to a probable opinion, and the more probable to the leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable: for it appears to me certain and evident, that ſometimes a probable opinion may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to a certain one: how ſhall we come to know when this is to be done? that is, ſays <hi>Suarez,</hi> when either juſtice, or charity do's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us, to prevent the dammage that may happen by the thing it ſelf, or the danger of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us go, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the Jeſuits have carried the cauſe and they will carry it before any impartial judge: any man of ſenſe, who will but hear and examin it, as we have now done. They went abroad to take the air a little wearied by the application their curioſity had given them, but mighty well ſatisfied they had clear'd and diſintangled the truth of things, from all the clouds and obſcurities, wherein it had a long time layn induſtriouſly conceal'd and folded up.</p>

                  <head>The following part of the fourth Dialogue.</head>
                  <p>AT their return from taking the air, they alighted at the Abbot's lodging, where, after they had, for ſome time, talk'd of indifferent things, being at a ſtand, and the converſation fallen, <hi>Eudoxus</hi> thus briskly took it up agen. But what think you, in the main, Maſter Abbot, of the queſtion of probable opinions? let us lay aſide the matter of fact, and the ſenſe of others, and tell us your own thoughts of the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I ſhou'd be hard put to it, anſwer'd the Abbot, if I were oblig'd to declare my ſelf in this particular. 'Tis a matter wherein it is as eaſy to deſtroy all, as it is hard to eſtabliſh any thing: where the extream, and directly contrary opinions, ſeem to have inſupportable conſequences; and where the middle, which ſome are willing to hold, ſeems not poſſible to ſubſiſt, without reeſtabliſhing the foundations of the two opinions, which they pretend to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>This is a very ſtrange propoſition, ſayd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus:</hi> but if it be true, the poſitive, magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial air, which ſome certain people put on, and affect in this matter, is not to be endur'd.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt part of theſe men, anſwer'd the Abbot, have div'd very little into the buſineſs, but ſuffer'd themſelves to be carried away with the ſtream of the party, they firſt met; or to be dazzl'd with outward appearances, which have in them nothing that's ſolid; or elſe to be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:174113:74"/>ſhun'd with the clamors and out-crys rais'd, by concert or agreement, in <hi>Flanders</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> and which have been ecchoed and heard as far as to <hi>Rome.</hi> But here they move more ſlowly, and walk with a graver pace, and are not in ſo much haſt, nor very forward to decide in ſo nice and tender a point. All that I can ſay to you, is, that I cannot bear <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wendrok's</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that I do yet ſuſpend my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the opinions of other Divines.</p>
                  <p>It looks well notwithſtanding, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> to ſay, that one is oblig'd always to follow the more ſafe opinion, thô it ſhould be the leſs probable. Has not <hi>Wendrok</hi> ſayd wonders in his firſt note upon the fifth Provincial Letter, where he propoſes his ſyſtem, and fights with all his forces that of his adverſaries, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſingle body of the Jeſuits? For theſe Fathers are there brought to anſwer for all the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> all the <hi>Scotists,</hi> all the Doctors of <hi>Salamanca, Alcala, Louvain</hi> and <hi>Sorbonne;</hi> for all the Canoniſts, and all the Biſhops you have nam'd to us, and to whom had they ſpoke to them in their proper perſons, it would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been very rude, to have offer'd ſo many injuries, and ſayd ſo many contumelious things, as he has done.</p>
                  <p>All that is admirable, anſwer'd the Abbot; and above all this fine principle, upon which all the reſt depends, that no probable opinion is ſafe, and that it do's not excuſe from ſin, if it be not true;
<note place="margin">Sect. 4. paragr. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>opinionem probabilem ſecuram non eſſe niſi vera ſit.</hi> Inſomuch that any judgment
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:174113:75"/>upon which I lean, whether it be to govern my ſelf, or to direct others, that conſult me; this judgment, I ſay, how probable, and how well ſoever founded, if it be falſe, makes me a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and guilty before the tribunal of the divine juſtice. It is, without doubt, this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and erroneous principle, of which the abſurd conſequences are eaſily known, that has contributed moſt to make this opinion fall to the ground.</p>
                  <p>For, notwithſtanding, all they cou'd do, the Doctors and Directors, moſt zealous for the reformation of Morals, were not able to make it ſerve their turn in ſpite of all that was moſt ſpecious in this ſeverity, and of the honor, and reputation it wou'd have brought to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and advice, and notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and the intereſt they had to give into the notions of one kind of devotes, by declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loudly and univerſally for the more ſafe opinion, they are agreed, that there is no ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in this doctrin, and convinc'd by reaſon and by experience that it is both impertinent and impracticable.</p>
                  <p>Not to be able to quiet the conſcience, but by evidence, which is wanting often and almoſt always in moral things, to reduce all the Judges even after they have done their duty exactly to doubt (I ſpeak of well grounded doubt, and not of a ſcruple) whether they do not make themſelves lyable to go to the Devil almoſt by all the judgments they paſs. For the moſt juſt and impartial are daily divided amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:174113:75"/>that is to ſay, that neceſſarily the one, or other of them in this oppoſition of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, judge and decide the contending parties differences upon falſe principles, or by miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying true ones, and that thereby they do an act of injuſtice, which neither their application, nor their examination of the affair, nor the care they take to follow that, which ſeems to them the more probably true, nor the authority of the moſt able Lawyers, can excuſe ſince that after all this they lay hold on a falſe opinion, and which at the ſame time is contrary to juſtice. To throw into the ſame uncertainty, by the ſame reaſon, all Lawyers, Advocates, Procters and Atturneys, almoſt for all the cauſes they take in hand, among which 'tis certain there are very few that have as clear a right of their ſide, as there is truth in a mathematical demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; and all thoſe that have litigious rights and cauſes, for all the ſuits they bring and maintain. To give the ſame kind of trouble to all Directors, and all Confeſſors in an infinity of deciſions, eſpecially, in the matter of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, where it is as little ſafe, to oblige as not to oblige to reſtitution, and where it is equally dangerous, on both ſides, to offend, or ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt juſtice: and to all Merchants, in, I know not, how many circumſtances, of their trade and dealings, and generally to all men, in an infinit number of conjunctures, where the daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of life do's engage them, and wherein they are govern'd by probable opinions only: all this appear'd very intolerable.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:174113:76"/>
                  <p>Beſides this other principle, which <hi>Wendrok</hi> farther ſuppoſes, for the eſtabliſhment of his doctrin, that invincible ignorance do's not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe from ſin, is a principle, whatever efforts are made in it's favor, that reaſon cannot admit, and which is repugnant to the notions, all men have, of the goodneſs of God, and which of late, was alſo cenſur'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and which, in effect reeſtabliſhes ſome of the condemn'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and undermines the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſome of the moſt important doctrins of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all, the ineffectual remedy for all theſe great inconveniences, and the only one ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by <hi>Wendrok,</hi> is, to addreſs ones ſelf to God, as if a man cou'd be certain, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a particular revelation from on high. Notwithſtanding theſe reaſons, they were, I ſay, oblig'd to quit this fine piece of Divinity. But it do's not appear, that either <hi>Wendrok,</hi> or his friends were much troubl'd for't. The oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was then made to this ſpecious ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, together with the pretended looſneſs of the Society's Morals, ſerv'd well enuff to decry and run down the Jeſuits; this was all theſe Gentlemen aim'd at, and they had all the reaſon in the world to be ſatisfied with the event.</p>
                  <p>I very lately puzzl'd, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> upon this ſubject, a Doctor of the ſevere Morals by a difficulty I propoſed to him, concerning the contracts for incomes upon the loon of mony. It is certain, ſayd I to him, that theſe kind of contracts can be juſtified, only by probable
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:174113:76"/>reaſons. They have been in uſe, or, at leaſt, well warranted, but within theſe two or three laſt ages. In the beginning they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by ſeveral Doctors, uſurious contracts, and altogether unjuſt, whereby twice as much mony was repaid as was at firſt receiv'd; ſince it will plainly appear, by redeeming, at the end of twenty years, the agreed for ſum of a thouſand pounds a year, after the rate of five in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and cleaving for the whole time the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, that the mony firſt borrowed with juſt as much more was fully paid back. This buſineſs was then diſputed, with ſo great variety of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that even to our days the diſpute of the three contracts was ſtill kept on foot. It is alſo certain, that this kind of contract is to be juſtified by a good intention, which men have to purchaſe, by parting for ever with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, not a certain ſum of mony yearly paiable, (for mony is not to be bought with mony) but a right of exacting, every year, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſum from him, to whom the principal was given. This is a very nice and tender point. He ought to have anſwer'd, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, that two Popes, <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Callixtus</hi> the third, did tolerate, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove theſe ſort of bargains, in the Decretals they made upon this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>He gave me this anſwer, replyed <hi>Cleander,</hi> but I thus purſued my argument; beſides ſayd I to him that the Popes can neither derogate from, nor deſtroy the law of nature, to which, many Doctors do affirm and maintain, that,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:174113:77"/>this contract is as oppoſit and contrary, as is the moſt formal kind of uſury. Beſides this, many of thoſe, we know, who hold that the moſt ſafe opinion is always to be followed, do not hold, that the Pope's authority is ſufficient, to make an opinion certain, if it were before doubtful; and that theſe two Popes do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this contract, but on two conditions, not to mention ſome others, which they do alſo require. The firſt is, that the rent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com ſhou'd be in the manner of a mortgage, and ſetl'd upon ſome certain, fix'd, fund, of a nature to produce a revenue, for example, upon an eſtate in land, or upon a houſe. The ſecond is, that, this fund failing, the rent ſhou'd be no longer paid: conditions which made eaſy the greateſt difficulties the Doctors had rais'd upon this kind of contract.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>France,</hi> theſe conditions are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, he that borrows mony binds all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, in general, and his own perſon into the bargain; that, if his eſtate ſhou'd faile, the perſon ſhou'd always remain bound. <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, ſince theſe two Popes, and the Council of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> held in the laſt age, ſay, that theſe two conditions, which I have mention'd, are neceſſary. Whence it is evident, that it is more ſafe, not to have, not to make, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch kind of contracts, or bargains, at leaſt, after the manner they are made in <hi>France.</hi> For to examin this buſineſs well to the bottom, they have not found, for theſe two or three hundred years, any new demonſtration to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:174113:77"/>juſtify this contract, more convincing, than the reaſons at that time propos'd to ſupport it; nor a more ſolid refutation of their arguments who condem'd it; that is to ſay in one word, that there is but a great probability to juſtify this kind of bargain or contract.</p>
                  <p>This probability then is not an aſſurance, that it is conformable to the law of nature, however it may be allow'd of, by cuſtom and by reaſons, which ſeem very probable, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt good men, and to the greateſt part of the learned. But if theſe learned men, who are but Schoolmen, Canoniſts, or Caſuiſts, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in a matter, ſo ſubject to error, what ſhall become of an infinit number of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of all eſtates, conditions, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who daily either give, or take mony, at this kind of intereſt? What ſhall become of us in <hi>France?</hi> where the conditions are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, which the Popes believe neceſſary, to hinder this contract from being dangerous, and with which many Doctors did not yet judge it ſafe enuff, and without which abundance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers accounted it unſupportable. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that in this, all follow the probable and leſs ſafe opinion. I aſſure you, added <hi>Cleander,</hi> that my man was ſo puzzl'd, he knew not what to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I do not at all wonder at it, ſayd the Abbot, any man of ſenſe cannot but ſee, that theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are unanſwerable, and plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, what a folly it is, to build on certain general maxims, which, at firſt, ſeem clear,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:174113:78"/>thô they are indeed but dazling, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, in an infinit number of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, abſolutely impoſſible. A thouſand ſuch like arguments, as you have told us might be made, upon this ſubject, and which can never be anſwer'd. I know continu'd he, that in the firſt heat of the pretended reformation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<note place="margin">Cas de Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence de S. Beuve tom. 1. p. 583.</note> this caſe was propos'd: they drew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out on't, as well as they cou'd; but upon every little difficulty, and diſſatisfaction found in their anſwers, by thoſe who conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, they were forc'd to acknowledge, that men were not oblig'd always to follow the more ſafe opinion. But, in a word, when once any doctrin makes an univerſal trouble and diſorder in civil affairs, that very diſorder ought to paſs for a moral demonſtration that it is falſe; and that it is againſt the order of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and, by conſequence, againſt the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal verities, of which common ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are but the expreſſions which make part of the rules, God has given us for our conduct. And thence it is, that ſuch a doctrin has ſo ſhort a duration, the common fate of all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and unreaſonable opinions.</p>
                  <p>But is what you affirm certain, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that this opinion is laid aſide? for I ſtill meet, every day, men, who, in ſpeaking of theſe matters, do generally declare, that we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow the more ſafe opinion. This being moſt favorable to the law, as they expreſs themſelves, and moſt contrary to concupiſcence, that this was the method of all true Chriſtians,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:174113:78"/>and that the doctrin of probability was never known, or taken, in any manner, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and the believers of the firſt ages, for a rule of the manners, and conduct of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>How eaſy it is, anſwer'd the Abbot, for a man, to make himſelf a Doctor of the ſevere Morals, ſuch a degree, or Doctorſhip, requires neither ſtudy nor learning; there is no more neceſſary for it, but a little confidence to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine poſitively in company, and to condem, or dam all the world; I do not ſpeak of theſe ſort of men, when I ſay <hi>Wendrok's</hi> doctrin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point, is out of date. I ſpeak of the moſt able Confeſſors, and Directors of the beſt credit of this age; who do not, at all, follow it, either in their practice, or deciſions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have found it's principles falſe, and it's conſequences extravagant, and who, in theſe days, commonly hold for a maxim, that when two contrary opinions meet, the leſs ſafe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very ſafe, by the ſtrength of the reaſons whereby it exceeds it's oppoſit; I ſpeak of the Divines, who, for ſeveral years paſt, have in their writings treated of probability, and, who, except two or three, that are oblig'd to ſwallow a hundred abſurdities, and to engage themſelves in a thouſand contradictions, do confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the refutation of this doctrin, that one may follow an opinion, which is both the leſs probable and the leſs ſafe opinion, and to prove, that one may not follow the leſs ſafe, but when it is the more probable opinion;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:174113:79"/>but nothing is more falſe, than what theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Doctors of <hi>Wendrok's</hi> character, as little skilful in Divinity, and full as bold as himſelf, have had the confidence to advance, that the doctrin of probability was never acknowledg'd in any manner by the Fathers or believers of the firſt ages for a rule of manners.</p>
                  <p>They ſtand very much upon it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> and, build a great deal upon this negative argument. It is true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Abbot, that it was not then diſputed in the Schools, whether a probable opinion might be follow'd, when it was the leſs ſafe; but it is alſo true, that, in practice, the moſt holy men did govern themſelves by it without ſcruple, when they met with difficulties, which cou'd not eaſily be determin'd by the chief and inviolable rules of our manners, the Scripture, the Canons, and the laws and conſtitutions of Eccleſiaſtic ſuperiors; and when there was any diſpute about the ſenſe and meaning of theſe very rules,
<note place="margin">Let not him that cateth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe him that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not.</note> in ſome circumſtances, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were divided, every one took what ſide he pleas'd, and ſayd with Saint <hi>Paul Qui non manducat manducantem non ſpernat, &amp; qui mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, non manducantem non ſpernat.</hi> This puts me in mind, continu'd he, of a very nice conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, of the Chriſtians, in the time of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtat, reported in the Eccleſiaſtical hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and which will ſerve for an example and proof of what I ſay.</p>
                  <p>This Emperor,

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:174113:79"/>that all the victuals, expos'd to ſale in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſhou'd be defil'd by pagan ſuperſtitions; and particularly directed, that all, there to be ſold, ſhou'd be firſt offer'd to Idols. The Chriſtians of this great City did believe, that, in conſcience, they ought not to buy any thing in the market, inſomuch, that as long as this order was in force, they only fed upon the corn which the rich had in their granaries, and which, without grinding, they got dreſt as well as they cou'd.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Prince publiſh'd, and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſuch an other edict at <hi>Antioch;</hi> but the Chriſtians there, were of a different opinion from thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> they bought, and, after their uſual manner, eat of what was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly ſold. The Church, which was much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the conduct of the Chriſtians at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiople,</hi> was not at all ſcandaliz'd, at the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who reports this matter, do's approve and juſtify it, by a paſſage of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, Whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the uſage of probability, ſayd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus,</hi> eſtabliſh'd, as much as poſſible, by the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:174113:80"/>contrary practiſes, and behaviour of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of theſe two Citys; and by that of the Church in reference to thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> for, without doubt, <hi>Theodoret,</hi> by approving the fact, did not believe they were oblig'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the more ſafe opinion.</p>
                  <p>The very Scripture it ſelf, anſwer'd the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
<note place="margin">L. 1. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha. c. 2.</note> can furniſh me with examples of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, about the deciſion of the great caſe of conſcience propos'd in the Jewiſh Church in the time of the renoun'd <hi>Antiochus viz,</hi> whether it were lawful to fight upon the Sabboth day, the Jews had, then, neither the Ark nor the Prophets to conſult, but debated the matter in a councel of war, and concluded, they might fight upon the Sabboth day; this was the leſs ſafe opinion, which ſeem'd contrary to the law, and to all the former preſidents of that nation in matter of Religion.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Wendrok,</hi> ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him, had been of this councel of war, and had read in it his diſſertation upon the fifth Provincial Letter, <hi>Mathatias</hi> and <hi>Judas Machabeus</hi> wou'd have been, infallibly confounded and turn'd into ridicule.</p>
                  <p>No doubt on't, anſwer'd the Abbot, but to return to the Chriſtians of the firſt ages; when I reflect upon the manner of their conduct, it ſeems to me, that men were never more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by probable opinions, than they were at that time; nor ever practis'd more the maxim, which teaches, that one may in conſcience fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the opinion of a Doctor of reputation for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:174113:80"/>probity and learning; that a Biſhop, a Prieſt, and a Deacon having gain'd the people's eſteem and good opinion, their judgment and ſenſe of things were receiv'd as Oracles, and blindly follow'd, in ſuch matters, as the Scriptures, or the Councels had left undetermin'd. Whereby you may ſee, that <hi>Wendrok,</hi> and all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are much out in their account; for after this, how can it be ſayd or maintain'd, that there are no footſteps of probability in the Scripture, or in the holy Fathers, or in the practice of the firſt ages of the Church?</p>
                  <p>As concerning the Fathers, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, I'le tell you a pleaſant adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of which ſome days ago I was a witneſs, and comes now into my mind properly enuff. I was at the Biſhop of ****<hi>'s</hi> houſe; where there was a great deal of good company, and, among others, a Janſeniſt Abbot, who turn'd the diſcourſe to the Morals of the Jeſuits; of whom he talk'd wonders, eſpecially touching the article we are now upon. The Prelat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of wit and judgment, and not an opiniator, growing weary of his too tedious diſcourſe, ſayd laughing, I muſt tell you, Mr. Abbot, of a deciſion lately made in the <hi>Indies,</hi> by the principles of probability; but, upon condition, that you'l get it inſerted in the eighth tome of <hi>La Morale pratique</hi> before it be finiſh'd by Mr. <hi>Arnauld.</hi> I do promiſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Abbot very readily, that, if you judge it worthy, it ſhall have there a very good place. You your ſelf, replied the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:174113:81"/>ſhall be the judge; the matter of fact is this.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>French</hi> Merchant, who had a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom wife, was ſhipwrack'd in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ſav'd himſelf in a City belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being a ſtranger, he was carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governor, a violent brutal man, who, at firſt ſight, fell deſperatly in love with the woman; the Merchant had notice of it, and, being very much diſturb'd and uneaſy, went to the College of that City, and deſir'd to ſpeak to a Caſuiſt and a Divine; he told them the difficulty he was in; ſaying that he knew from good hands, that the Governor was ſo paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly in love with his wife, that he wou'd glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Marry her, if ſhe were not already Married. For he do's not yet certainly know, ſays he, that ſhe is my wife; perſons well inform'd of the matter do aſſure me, that he is reſolv'd to have me murder'd, in caſe he finds me to be her husband; or that I ſhou'd oppoſe his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. And, on the other ſide, if I ſuffer him to Marry her, he'l give me an employment, that will make amends for the great loſſes I have ſuſtain'd by ſhipwrack. I can very well conceal my Marriage, there being no body here acquainted with it, and make her paſs for my kinſwoman, and relation, as ſhe really is, and ſo near, that I was forc'd to get a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to Marry her. I am ſure ſhe will do any thing I ſhall bid her; but I wou'd not willingly offend God. I have had a thouſand times the benefit of his Divine protection, and,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:174113:81"/>even now, he ſeems to inſpire me with ſome confidence, that he will hinder the execution of the Governor's ill deſigns againſt my wife.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Divine, who ſpake firſt ſayd, that he very much pitied his caſe, and declar'd to him there was nothing elſe to be done, but to give an heroic proof of his faith, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his life, a Sacrifice to Almighty God; for if he were ask'd, whether the woman were his wife, and he ſhou'd anſwer ſhe was his kinſwoman, this muſt needs be, either a ly, or an equivocation; neither of which is lawful: but the greateſt evil of this buſineſs was, that he cou'd not adviſe his wife to conceal her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, and to ſay ſhe was but his relation, without viſibly expoſing her to commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and making himſelf a complice; that, if he had ſo great a confidence in the Divine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, he ought ſtill to hope, and rely upon the goodneſs of God, for delivering him from his preſent danger, by ſome particular way he cou'd not foreſee; but to believe that God ſhou'd change the Governor's heart, in reference to his wiſe, or preſerve her, from the crime to which ſhe her ſelf wou'd conſent, cou'd not but be a moſt damnable preſumption. This was not a Jeſuit's deciſion, ſayd our Janſeniſt Abbot.</p>
                  <p>Have a little patience, continued the Prelat; the Caſuiſt too ſpoke, in his turn, and declar'd to the Merchant, that he was of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: that as to the firſt point, in ſaying this perſon was his kinſwoman, he ſhou'd not tell a ly; he ſhou'd indeed thereby conceal the truth,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:174113:82"/>but not ſay any thing that was falſe; wherein there is nothing of evil: and, as for the act of adultery, to which his wife was expos'd, this cou'd not be imputed to him for a fault; that by praying to God, and truſting in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he ſatisfi'd his duty; and if to take this courſe was to tempt God; to preſume that he wou'd ſave his life in a conjuncture wherein his death was morally inevitable, wou'd be to tempt him much more. But in going this way, he was to take care, not to have the preciſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to avoid death thereby, but withal he ought to be ready, as he ſayd he was, to do any thing rather than offend God.</p>
                  <p>Ho there ſpoke the Jeſuit, anſwer'd the Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt, and if the other alſo were one, here is directly Mr. <hi>Paſcal's</hi> diviſion, of the Jeſuit Directors, of which ſome are ſevere, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers looſe even to exceſs.</p>
                  <p>Without donbt, ſayd the Biſhop, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine's opinion was the more ſafe, and the more probable, and the Caſuiſts, the leſs ſafe and the leſs probable. Moſt certainly, anſwer'd the Janſeniſt, who earneſtly deſir'd to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter of fact was true, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd as excellent for the <hi>Morale Pratique.</hi> The Biſhop, perceiving him catch'd and drawn in, ſayd to him laughing, indeed, Mr. Abbot, what I have told you, is but a Parable, of which I will now tell you the meaning. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's caſe is, in reality, that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which you are not a ſtranger; who, to avoid the danger of death, adviz'd <hi>Sara</hi> to ſay to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:174113:82"/>
                     <hi>Pharoo's</hi> people, and to <hi>Abimelech's,</hi> that ſhe was his Siſter,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. 3 ad Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad.</note> without ſaying that ſhe was his wife. The Divine was Saint <hi>John Chryſoſtom;</hi> who plainly condems <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a man, who conſented to the adultery of his wife; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers up the ſheep to the wolfe; who deceiv's, and who is an example to the greateſt Saints, to let them ſee what they are capable of, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their Sanctity. But the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt is Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 22. contra Fauſt. c. 33. &amp; ſeq.</note> who ſayd in expreſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal terms, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> in ſaying <hi>Sara</hi> was his Siſter, had done no ill; becauſe he only conceal'd part of the truth, and told nothing that was falſe, <hi>Tacuit aliquid veri &amp; non dixit aliquid falſi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That is not yet all, continued he, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſayd Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> looks, at firſt, like that of a husband, who gives up his wife to commit a crime; but it will not appear ſo to any, but to thoſe, who know not how to diſtinguiſh, by the light of the eternal law, between good and bad actions. This Patriarch, perſued the Father, did not conſent to his wife's adultery .... but, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing ſhe was his wife, and ſaying ſhe was his Siſter, his intention was, that theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ungodly men ſhou'd not kill him, leaſt that after his death they ſhou'd treat her like a captive.</q> He adds the circumſtances, and the reaſons mention'd in the expoſition of the caſe of conſcience, and in the Caſuiſt's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and above all, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was in hopes, that, whatever happen'd, God wou'd protect
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:174113:83"/>his wife. Where you ſee, concluded the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes good uſe of the direction of intention; and that he decides, at laſt, the caſe of conſcience like a Doctor who believ'd one might follow the leſs ſafe opinion, as <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf had done. It is certain, neither of them reaſon'd very well, if they did not judge, that this leſs ſafe, was, at the ſame time, the leſs probable opinion; and if they believ'd it ſuch, we muſt ſay they were, of the ſame opinion with thoſe, who hold, that the leſs ſafe opinion may be follow'd, even when it is the leſs probable.</p>
                  <p>Our Janſeniſt, continued <hi>Cleander,</hi> was a little ſurpriz'd; and the trouble he was in; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the company very much; he ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, that nothing like this cou'd ever be ſhewn him in Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> The Biſhop of *** hereupon reach'd down the ſixth tome of this Father, and ſhew'd him, at large, the caſe and the deciſion in the 22th book againſt <hi>Fauſtus;</hi> giving him alſo to underſtand, that it was not in conſcience ſafe, nor ſo much as probable, that they might run down their neighbors, with that paſſion and madneſs, wherewith his good friends the Janſeniſts ſeem'd poſſeſs'd, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming eternally againſt the Jeſuits: and that it wou'd be much more edifying to practiſe, without preaching, the ſevere Morals; than to preach them, every where, and yet practiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to what they preach. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> ſeems to me to be very wiſely and ſeaſonably given; and, if thoſe who
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:174113:83"/>ſpeak ſo diſadvantagiouſly of the Jeſuits Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, wou'd but reflect, upon the memorials, and the teſtimonies by which they are induc'd to ſpeak of them, after that manner; and upon the reaſons they might there find to believe the contrary of what is ſayd, upon the motives that there preſent themſelves to make a man diſtruſt the ſincerity, or the knowledg of thoſe, that decry them moſt, perhaps they wou'd believe, that this, at beſt, was but the leſs probable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; and that it was lawful to ſpeak thus, and to believe all that their enemies had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd of them. But alas it is but too true, that the men, moſt zealous for ſevere Morals, do, as often, as there is occaſion, diſpenſe with their moſt eſſential rules.</p>
                  <p>And what do they now think at <hi>Rome,</hi> ask'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> of this fine maxim, that men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oblig'd to follow the more ſafe opinion? they there condem it anſwer'd the Abbot; at leaſt <hi>Alexander</hi> VIII paſs'd his cenſure upon this following propoſition, <hi>That it is not lawful to follow a probable opinion, even the moſt probable, among all thoſe, that are probable, Non licet ſequi opinionem, vel inter probabiles probabiliſſimam,</hi> this propoſition, is the immediat conſequence of the other; for, if a man be oblig'd to follow the more ſafe, it thence evidently follows, that it is not lawful, to follow the contrary opinion, how probable ſoever it may be.</p>
                  <p>That is manifeſt, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> let us here then take our leave of <hi>Wendrok,</hi> with his mad extravagant Morals; but, continued he, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:174113:84"/>however eaſily give into the oppoſit opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; which teaches, that one may follow the leſs ſafe opinion, even when, at the ſame time, it is the leſs probable: why rather ſhou'd they not hold the middle opinion, according to which, men, may take the leſs ſafe, only, when it is the more probable.</p>
                  <p>I am of your mind, anſwer'd the Abbot, and have all the inclination poſſible to follow this middle opinion; and a great many of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Divines deſire it; but, having very well examin'd the whole matter, I find, that the Doctors, of this mitigated probability, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as hard put to it, as the others. It requires an entire book to ſhew you all the trouble given them, by thoſe, who hold the doctrin of the leſs probable opinion, and that which they themſelves alſo, in their turn, give to thoſe, who follow this opinion. I have at my houſe ſome volumes that might inſtruct you in the buſineſs, in caſe your curioſity and your patience cou'd carry you ſo far.</p>
                  <p>I do not intend it, replied <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and in all appearance, I ſhall content my ſelf in this matter, with the plain, naked, notion, you have given me of a probable opinion, which, if I well remember, is an opinion not contrary to faith, nor to the principles of faith, nor to any evident reaſon, that plauſibly anſwers all the arguments of the contrary opinion, and is, beſides, ſupported by one, or more, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reaſons, that is to ſay, reaſons capable to make an impreſſion upon a wiſe man, ſo far,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:174113:84"/>as to ſatisfy him, that the oppoſit opinion is not certain.</p>
                  <p>You take the thing very rightly, ſayd the Abbot, but you muſt alſo obſerve, that all theſe conditions ought to agree, even to the opinion they call the leſs probable. For all the Doctors of different Nations, different Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and different Orders, who have ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly taught, that the leſs ſafe opinion may be follow'd in conſcience, have always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that the leſs probable opinion, was truly probable; and that if the contrary opinion be ſo evident, and certain, that it takes from it its probability, it will no longer come within the ſtate of the queſtion. Inſomuch, that thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who ſay one may follow the leſs probable opinion, do only ſay, that an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be follow'd, which conſtantly has, and even by the very confeſſion of thoſe, or, at leaſt, the greateſt part of thoſe who oppoſe it, all thoſe conditions, as well negative as poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as they are commonly call'd. By which, as you may ſee, the doctrin of the Fathers, of Tradition, and the Councels is ſecure; ſince the firſt precaution of theſe Divines, is to ſet down all this, as an inviolable rule, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare improbable, every thing, that is contrary to it, from the very moment it becomes contrary.</p>
                  <p>Althô this doctrin, thus explain'd, ſayd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> ſhou'd not be true, it is, at leaſt, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it is not extravagant, nor impious, nor abominable; and althô it ſhou'd not have been embrac'd, by ſo many learned and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:174113:85"/>perſons, as it has been, for ſo long a time, I wou'd not look upon it as ſuch. This is the only thing, anſwer'd the Abbot, that I pretend at preſent to make you conclude; and by this alone, I carry the cauſe againſt <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wendrok,</hi> in favor of the Jeſuits, and, an infinite number of other famous Divines.</p>
                  <p>As for me, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> till theſe diſputes he, once for all, determin'd, I wou'd, in the mean time, be glad there were a rule made, whereby all men ſhou'd be prohibited from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming, and roaring out againſt this doctrin, of the leſs probable opinion; and againſt the other propoſitions that relate to it; under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, that any one that did, ſhou'd be oblig'd, in practiſe, to follow the contrary opinion which in words he holds and maintains, That will never be done, ſayd the Abbot; there are too many concern'd to ſuffer it; the very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors themſelves wou'd oppoſe it. What for example wou'd Mr. **** ſay, if one of his ſhe penitents, reflecting upon part of her fortune, and doubting whether it were well or ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, ſhou'd not in the matter refer her ſelf to him, upon pretenſe, that one ſingle Doctor cannot make an opinion probable, much leſs ſafe, and that ſhe ſhou'd therefore require him to produce the opinions of a dozen Doctors under their hands and ſeals?</p>
                  <p>What wou'd Mr. Abbot of **** ſay, if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the opinion, which allows the plurality of Benefices, to a man already poſſeſs'd of one of a conſiderable value, is, by conſent of all the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:174113:85"/>world, the leſs probable, and the leſs ſafe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; he ſhou'd in that point, be oblig'd to quit in practiſe, the doctrin of the leſs probable opinion; againſt which notwithſtanding he fly's out, and furiouſly runs it down in all places?</p>
                  <p>What are you in good earneſt, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and do's the opinion, which holds the plurality of benefices lawful, paſs for the leſs probable opinion? moſt aſſuredly anſwer'd the Abbot, and it is really ſo. Never any probable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, compar'd with its contrary, was more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the leſs probable opinion, than that is. Thoſe who talk otherwiſe, either do not ſpeak ſeriouſly, or elſe do not underſtand the right notion of probability.
<note place="margin">Seſſ. 24. c 17.

                  </p>
                  <p>I underſtand you, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> but in truth, if I ſhou'd govern my ſelf by prejudices, what
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:174113:86"/>you tell me, touching plurality of benefices, wou'd be ſufficient to convince me, that one might in conſcience follow the leſs probable and leſs ſafe opinion. For how many Biſhops, Abbots, and Regulars, do we hear lowdly preach and cry up ſevere Morals, and yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs more benefices than one good one? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, abundance of 'um have their Confeſſors and Directors, in the famous Seminaries of <hi>Paris;</hi> where nothing is ſo much talk'd of, as the ſevere Morals; and where ſome, even of thoſe who poſſeſs pluralitys, do actually dwell or reſide. It muſt therefore needs be, that the Confeſſors of theſe beneficed perſons, and the Confeſſors of their Confeſſors, and the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and moſt conſiderable in their Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, do believe, that they may in conſcience, follow the leſs ſafe, and the leſs probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. After this, the Janſeniſts muſt ſurely be very impudent, to attack the Jeſuits upon a point they are ſo far from abhorring in practiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuits, anſwer'd the Abbot, wou'd be very happy, if certain perſons of ſome Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, wou'd not make them criminal, for a doctrin, which they themſelves do ſo publicly follow, and juſtify by their practiſe. But this do's not at all hinder them, from inſtructing, at the very beginning, or, at leaſt, from very eaſily permitting, the young Abbots there edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, to cry out againſt, and, on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, run down the Morals of the Jeſuits, and to ridicule them, for their doctrin of probable opinions; and for an excellent model of this
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:174113:86"/>charitable rallery, the Provincial Letters are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put into their hands, together with <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok's</hi> elegant notes upon them. You may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelf, that I do not ſpeak at random of this matter; but am very well inform'd of all their proceedings; what is there done and what is ſayd upon this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>But let us I pray you, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> return to our Abbot of **** ſo zealous againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinions: no doubt, but this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with all his Priories and Abbeys, muſt needs have choſen his ſide, and concluded that it was worth going to the Devil for fifty or ſixty thouſand livers a year. For, after all, it being certain, according to the Caſuiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the only reſſource, for thoſe who hold pluralities, is the doctrin of the leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion, I dare not condem thoſe, who believe, in good earneſt, that it may be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd: but as for this man, whoſe zeal, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fury, ſtartles, at the very ſound of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, I wou'd fain know, how he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the thing? Is it not to pronounce the ſentence againſt himſelf? and can there ever be a perſon to whom God may with more juſtice ſay, <hi>Ex ore tuo te judico ſerve nequam?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Out of thy own mouth I condem you thou wicked Servant.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do expect, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that the firſt time I meet this Abbot, he ſhou'd tell me by what Morals he ordinarily governs himſelf in this matter; and I will propoſe to him before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, one of theſe three things; the retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all he has hitherto ſayd againſt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; or the quitting one of his three livings;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:174113:87"/>or the renouncing the ſhare he pretends to in paradiſe. But, in a word, continued <hi>Cleander,</hi> turning to the Abbot, you have undertaken no ſmall task, and are very well employ'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to defend the Jeſuits in this their favorit doctrin, as its commonly ſayd to be.</p>
                  <p>I know not how you underſtand the matter, anſwer'd the Abbot; but their conduct and proceeding in it, ſeems to me very clear, and the moſt reaſonable in the world. When their Doctors firſt enter'd the Univerſities and the Schooles, they found this, the common, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary doctrin, and the moſt follow'd of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, particularly by Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> diſciples; cou'd they have acted more prudently, than in conforming themſelves to it? ſome of them did not agree to it, but taught the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not only in the Claſſes, and in the Schooles, but alſo in their public printed books; they did it, without oppoſition, and with their Superiors approbation.</p>
                  <p>Since the violent exclaming and flying out againſt this doctrin, far from doing themſelves the honor of protecting it, every man, among 'um had the ſame liberty he enjoy'd before; of late, they taught the contrary to it in their College at <hi>Paris;</hi> and I am very well inform'd, that the ſame thing was done at <hi>Lions,</hi> and <hi>Tolouſe,</hi> at <hi>la Fleche,</hi> and at <hi>Rome.</hi> They have, lately, maintain'd it in public Theſes, in their College at <hi>Paris,</hi> of which I my ſelf was an eye witneſs. Others have taken the reſolution, I have done, to decide, or affirm nothing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:174113:87"/>in this matter. The books within theſe few years written by the Society, in favor of this opinion, were not ſo much to defend it, for an indiſputable doctrin, as to ſhew, that it had been poyſon'd and painted in ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible colors, to no other end, but that their Doctors might paſs for the great corrupters of Morals. They modeſtly repreſented to the public, that if there was any evil in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, they did 'um wrong, who endeavor'd, to make them anſwerable for it; they being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt, nor the only perſons who had taught it; and that it was the utmoſt malice, to ſingle out and diſtinguiſh them, on this account, from a croud of Biſhops, Doctors, and Divines, with whom, and after whom, they had but joyn'd in opinion.</p>
                  <p>Their adverſaries ſeem'd to think they had a mind to condem and baniſh it: I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they had, or ought to have any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; for being propounded and taken, as in reality it is and ought to be, with the uſual precautions and reſtrictions, and ſuch, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as the Jeſuits, among others, have added, and, having beſides been maintain'd, by this infinit number of learned Doctors, of whom I have ſhewn you the liſt, it has nothing in it, that cou'd make it deſerve to be condem'd and exploded. The Jeſuits do abhor it, as their adverſaries have repreſented it; they condem both its principles, and its conſequences; but under this diſguiſe they diſown it to be theirs. In a word, let but the Church ſpeak, or the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:174113:88"/>lawful powers declare themſelves, and, then notwithſtanding the numbers, and the merit of the Doctors, who, for theſe hunder'd and fifty years, have defended it, they wou'd condem it, and their Superiors wou'd, I am certain, forbid its being any longer taught, in all their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. They have always chalenged and defied their adverſaries, in the point of ſubmiſſion and obedience. Let but the Church declare her ſelf upon the arricle of probability, as ſhe has done upon the doctrin of <hi>Janſenius;</hi> and then the Jeſuits wou'd not afterwards be ſeen, to ſtick and boggle, nor to have recourſe to the diſtinction of Fact and Right, nor to any ſuch like pittiful, and trifling ſhifts, and artifices.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuits have, of late years, condem'd theſes and poſitions, and diſown'd certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, too lightly advanc'd by ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members, depos'd and turn'd out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, thoſe who had taught them, when they found 'um incorrigible, and blindly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, in matter of doctrin, to all the orders of the Church. I wiſh to God, we might ſee their example follow'd by a party, who do not oppoſe the Society, for any other reaſon, but becauſe, they know the Jeſuits the chief ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the Catholic doctrin, the deſtruction of which is theſe Gentlemens ultimat deſign. But this character of ſubmiſſion and obedience, was always the character of the true and faithful Sons of this holy Mother the Church; as that, of wrangling and obſtinacy, cheating and kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, was conſtantly the mark of faction and error.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:174113:88"/>
                  <p>Here the Abbot made an end; having firſt convinc'd <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> of the juſtice of the cauſe he had undertaken to defend. They made him afterwards promiſe, that he wou'd ſee them again next day, to examin the other accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations <hi>Paſcal</hi> had charg'd upon the Divines of the Society in his Provincial Letters.</p>

               <p>IMmediatly after dinner, <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> carryed the Abbot to the Janſeniſt's houſe, <hi>Eudoxus's</hi> friend, of whom they had ſpoke in the firſt diſcourſe, and who had by him all the Caſuiſts of the Society. They had great hopes to engage him to diſpute with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, that they might have the pleaſure to ſee, how each of 'um wou'd behave himſelf, and which wou'd come off beſt, in a matter of fact, to be made good, only, by looking into the books; and wherein nothing cou'd be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary but eyes, to decide the controverſy. But as ill luck wou'd have it, the new adverſary they had intended for the Abbot was not at home; yet notwithſtanding, they went directly to his library; whither as they were going <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> ſayd to the Abbot, we have really loſt half our deſign: For our intention was, to find out for you a ſtout antagoniſt; who might a little moderat that ardent zeal, which makes you ſo warm in defence of the Jeſuits. We two are a very unequal match for you; and the victories you obtain, by the advantage of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:174113:89"/>truth, wou'd be the more glorious, if they were a little better conteſted.</p>
               <p>I do not find, anſwer'd the Abbot, that you are of ſo gentle and plyable a mould, ſo eaſy as you pretend; you do indeed yield to truth, but not before you are convinc'd; and it was well for me, and abſolutly neceſſary, to have had good proofs and authentic pieces ready to produce. For, notwithſtanding all your compliments, and commendations of my ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I have not found you very forward, to take my word touching the matter in hand. But, however, I muſt confeſs you are very much in the right, and take the courſe every one ought to obſerve in their inquiries after truth.</p>
               <p>Tell me in good earneſt, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are as able to defend the Jeſuits, in the reſt, in all the other particular points, wherewith they are reproch'd, in the Provincial Letters, as you have ſeem'd to us, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral article of their conſpiracy, againſt the Morals of the Goſpel, in their empty, chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, diviſion, of ſtrict and looſe Directors, and in the particular one, the doctrin of probability.</p>
               <p>You your ſelves, anſwer'd the Abbot, ſhall be the judges; all I can ſay to you is, that I will not ſpare their Divines, when ever I find them faulty. But I deſire you wou'd not, upon <hi>Paſcal's</hi> word, and his odd notions, conclude every thing, without farther examining, to be looſe Morals, which in his Letters he call's by that name: And, if by chance, we ſhou'd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to find ſome Jeſuits go aſtray from the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:174113:89"/>rules of true Morals, be content to treat them, as you wou'd, in the like caſe, treat other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as you wou'd a Doctor of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> who got his book approv'd by three of his brethren; or a <hi>Dominican,</hi> whoſe work had the approbation of three Divines and a Provincial of his own Order. Blame them; but without imputing to the whole body, as a contagious diſeaſe, the ſins of a particular perſon. Nay, I will freely give up, even, the whole Society to your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if in any determination, evidently ill, I do not find out, among it's members, ten, twenty, for one, who have taught the contrary: Theſe conditions are not, I think, over advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for the Jeſuits, and yet if with all theſe they carry the cauſe, you cannot but conclude, that the right is on their ſide.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more equitable, than what you deſire, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> let us begin at one end and go, gradually, on to the other, the liſt of real, or pretended looſe deciſions begins in the fourth Letter. Wherein upon opening, ſee ſayd he, what <hi>Paſcal</hi> makes the Jeſuits here ſpeak, by the mouth of the good Father; who diſcovers to him all the ſecrets of the Society. <q>We do maintain as an undoubted principle, that an action cannot be imputed for a ſin, if God do's not give us, before its committal, a knowledge of the evil that is in it and an inſpiration exciting us to avoid it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, this is falſe, cry'd the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, and I boldly affirm the contrary; and that in the ſenſe <hi>Paſcal</hi> gives this propoſition, no
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:174113:90"/>Jeſuit ever taught any thing like it. Let us ſee, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> how well you can make out this beginning. Let us examin, continued the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, how many ſeveral ways, according to the Jeſuits, this propoſition is falſe. Firſt it is falſe in an infinity of actions, to which men are not mov'd by any paſſion, or tranſport; and which nature of it ſelf do's abhor; the Jeſuits, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the principles of the common, ordinary Divinity, do affirm that a man may ſin, and ſin mortally, althô God ſhou'd not have given him actual grace, or an inſpiration to avoid the ſin. I will explain my ſelf by an example, which will make you eaſily comprehend both theirs and my meaning.</p>
               <p>I have read ſome where or other, that a Chriſtian, a skilful Painter made a ſlave by the <hi>Turks,</hi> having preſented to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond, who underſtood painting very well the picture of Saint <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> head, the Emperor lik'd it, and ſayd to the painter, that it was a very good piece; but yet had one great fault; which was, his not having given to the head, that turn of the mouth, which is commonly ſeen in heads, that are cut off. And having ſayd this he call'd to him an other ſlave; drew out his Cymiter, and ſtruck off his head; to let the painter ſee by this horrible experiment the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his picture.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits all do, and will, ſay upon ſuch an occaſion as this, and an infinit number of others, where liberty, impunity, and very often the mad, fooliſh, vanity of deſigning to paſs
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:174113:90"/>for a libertin and an ungodly man makes ſome people, daily, commit, in cold blood, in ſpite of conſcience, and of nature, actions altogether unworthy either of a Chriſtian, or a man. I ſay on ſuch occaſions as theſe, men, without being prevented with that grace, which is call'd actual, or a Divine inſpiration, do frequently commit very great ſins: becauſe according to Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion,
<note place="margin">Lib. de Spir. &amp; li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>The image of God in our Souls, was not ſo defac'd by original ſin, but that there still do remain ſome ſtrokes and touches, by vertue of which, nature and reaſon alone are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to reſtrain men from committing ſuch bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities; and even to make the most vicious do, ſometimes, actions conformable to the law of God.</hi> And in this point, Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> do's perfectly agree with Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, the Jeſuits tell us, that when a man, fooliſhly, and with knowledge of the hazard, puts himſelf into a near and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous occaſion of ſining, the providence of God is, not, at all, engag'd to ſecure him; and that thô God ſhou'd not have given him any grace; in the inſtant preceding the ſin, to which he expos'd himſelf, this ſin, notwithſtanding, wou'd be imputed to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the ſins, the blaſphemies, for example committed by a drunken man, while drunk, are likewiſe imputed to him, althô, by reaſon of the condition he then is in, he can have no actual knowledge of the evil he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, nor any inſpiration to avoid it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they teach, that cuſtomary ſins,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:174113:91"/>for example, the falſe oaths, and imprecations made, by a common ſwearer, are all imputed to him, althô he commits theſe ſins without reflexion, or the actual knowledge of what he do's, unleſs that being truly touch'd with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the ſins he had committed in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he do not heartily deteſt the cuſtom he has got, and deſtroy it, as much as lyes in him, by a real and ſincere repentance.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">Suarez, Vaſquez, La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>man, Sauchez, Lugo Vaſentia, Tannetus &amp;c</note> they all teach, that the ſins of <hi>vincible</hi> ignorance, that is to ſay, the actions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the law, and a command, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ought and might have been inſtructed, are alſo imputed to thoſe, who commit them; althô they were done without any actual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the evil, and that they had no inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before hand. After this, he ſhew'd them, in ſeveral of the Jeſuits books, he there found, and wherein theſe matters were handled, the doctrin he had expounded to them.</p>
               <p>You may now perceive, added the Abbot, whether this propoſition, <hi>That no action can be imputed for a ſin, if God gives us not before its committal the knowledge of its evil, and an inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that ſtirs us up to avoid it;</hi> whether I ſay this propoſition, which according to the Jeſuits, is ſo many ways falſe, be, among them, <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable principle,</hi> as they are here made to ſay.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that, as to this laſt point, the Jeſuits cou'd not declare themſelves more poſitively, than they have done in their book, intitled, <hi>L'erreur du Péché Philoſophique combattuë par les Jéſuites.</hi> No body cou'd defend
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:174113:91"/>themſelves better, than they have done upon this occaſion; wherein it was certainly ſeen, and with good reaſon, that they took the thing to heart. Here is the book you mention, ſayd the Abbot, drawing it out of his pocket. Ho! ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> laughing, nothing is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Mr. Abbot, than that you have prepared your ſelf for this combat. Ha! cou'd you doubt it, anſwer'd the Abbot? cou'd you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I cou'd have been ſo perfect in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if I had not reflected on them anew; and wou'd it not have been a piece of raſhneſs in me, to have ſpoken of them, before two men of your ſenſe, without having firſt conſider'd very well, what I was to ſay; and before two witty men, who, notwithſtanding all their equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wou'd have had, like many others, ſome ſmall malicious pleaſure, to ſee the Jeſuits found ſomewhat leſs innocent, than, I ſay, they are in the things, whereof they ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd. Here in the nineteenth page is the place you ſpeak of, continued he.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yes, Sir, of ſo great number of Jeſuits, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Scripture, School Divines, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſits, Caſuiſts, or Canoniſts, Writers of Spiritual treatiſes, Preachers, and even Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers themſelves, I defy you, to find one ſingle man, who, treating of ignorance, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in reference to our duty, has not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, that which is blamable, from that which is not; and who has not ſayd, that neither ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, nor inadvertence, do's ever excuſe from the evil one is ignorant of, by a criminal wilful neglect.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:174113:92"/>
               <p>Behold, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> an induction general enuff, and very exact; which, without leaving out one, runs thro' all the ſeveral ſorts of writers; and it muſt needs be, that the Jeſuits have ſayd nothing but truth on this occaſion, ſince no body has thought fit to contradict them, or ſhew the contrary. That therefore which the Jeſuits wou'd ſay, continued the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, by the propoſition, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> attributes to 'um, or rather, that which they wou'd ſay, by ſome other propoſitions, which comes near to that, and which he reduces to it, to poyſon more eaſily their doctrin, is no more than this, that every actual ſin is voluntary, either in it ſelf, or in its cauſe; that men do never offend God by neceſſity; and that to be criminal, even in the ſtate of corrupted nature; they muſt be free agents, and under no neceſſity. You are not now to learn the reaſon, why this wou'd pleaſe neither <hi>Paſcal</hi> nor his friends.
<note n="*" place="margin">This doctrin of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory of that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demd in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But I am not yet, anſwer'd the Abbot; read again, if you pleaſe, this very paſſage, and that which follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eudoxus</hi> read, a ſecond time, this paſſage of <hi>Paſcal.</hi> 
                  <q>We do then maintain, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principle, <hi>That no action can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as a ſin, if God gives us not before we commit it, a knowlege of the evil that's in it, and an inſpiration to incite us to avoid it.</hi> Do you now comprehend what I wou'd be at? aſtoniſh'd at ſuch a diſcourſe, according to which, all ſins of ſurpriſe, and ſuch as men
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:174113:92"/>commit, without once thinking of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imputed........</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hold there, ſayd the Abbot, what notion have you of theſe words? They give me to underſtand, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> as all the reſt of the Letter do's, that, according to the doctrin of the Jeſuits, as Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> explanes it, <hi>there can be no ſin of ſurpriſe;</hi> that all the crimes of harden'd libertins, <hi>who run headlong and wilfully into a forgetfulneſs of God, are no longer ſins;</hi> and that, as he ſays, ſome pages after, <hi>when once a man has prevail'd upon himſelf, to think no more of God, he cannot afterwards offend him;</hi> that he is very ſilly, who ſins but by halves; <hi>that theſe half ſinners, who ſtill retain ſome love for vertue, ſhall all be dam'd; but as for the thorow pac'd ſinners, harden'd ſinners, ſinners without any mixtures of goodneſs, compleat, and perfect ſinners, there can be no place found for them in hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, by the expoſition I have made you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Abbot, and by all, I have ſhewn you, in the Jeſuits books, can you form to your ſelf the fame kind of notion; no, by no means, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> I conceive juſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for it is evident to me, that there are many ſins of ſurpriſe; as your habitual ſwearers fully demonſtrate; and that the forgetting God, being voluntary in libertins, it muſt neceſſarily be, according to the Society's Divinity, that they are guilty of all the crimes they act, during this forgetfulneſs; and that they will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly more puniſh'd for them, than the <hi>half ſinners who have ſtill ſome love for vertue.</hi> In a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:174113:93"/>word, we muſt acknowledge, that this of <hi>Paſcal</hi> is a meer calumny.</p>
               <p>I am now content, anſwer'd the Abbot, but if you deſire to ſatisfy your ſelves, yet more fully upon this ſubject, read the Jeſuits ſecond Letter concerning Philoſophic ſin. See, how in that they explain it.
<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note>
                  <q>The new hereſy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us,
<note place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> is, to maintain that all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and all forgetfulneſs of God, althô voluntary, and blamable, as in Atheiſts, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, Libertins, and all other ſinners, whoſe examples the accuſer has made uſe of, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this hereſy, that all manner of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and all kind of forgetfulneſs of God, are ſufficient, to ſecure us againſt committing any ſins, but philoſophic ſins, which do not offend God, we all condem this as an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſy; but, at the ſame time, we ſay, it was never taught by any of our writers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Read this book alſo,

                  <hi>de l'erreur du Péché Philoſophique combattuë par les Jéſuites pag.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here you will ſee the whole doctrin, of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety upon this ſubject, perfectly expounded; that which, as well the Jeſuit Divines, as the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> and all others mean, when they ſay, that to offend God, the malice of the ſin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to be known, is, that one muſt reflect upon the evil that is in it, as the Libertins often do, in ſpite of their forgetting God. In a word, you'l find in theſe two books, all that relates to this matter, admirably well handled, and clear'd from all difficulties.</p>
               <p>The Abbot alſo made them read a paſſage in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:174113:93"/>
                  <hi>Suarez,</hi> where he explains what inadvertence is;
<note place="margin">Suarez de actibus hum. diſp. 7.</note> and do's it, in the moſt handſom, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible manner, ſo abſtracted and ſo hard a ſubject is capable of; which, for its difficulties, was purpoſely choſen by the Janſeniſts, to confound thoſe things, which every body is not able to make plain and clear.</p>
               <p>Let us go on, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> to the Abbot, you have, for certain, ſav'd the body of the Jeſuits; but I know not whether you are able, upon the ſame article, to ſave Father <hi>Bauni, qui tollit peccata mundi,</hi> ſays <hi>Paſcal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVho takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſins of the world.</note> and as was formerly ſayd by Mr. <hi>Hallier,</hi> when he fell out with the Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>Althô I were not able, anſwer'd the Abbot, I ſhou'd be but little concern'd for't. And I am perſuaded, the Jeſuits themſelves wou'd not be much troubled, and wou'd be the firſt to condem him, if he had maintain'd the doctrin, <hi>Paſcal</hi> aſcribes to him. But let us ſee how the matter ſtands.</p>
               <p>Then they read in <hi>Paſcal</hi> the words of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bauni,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins.</note> taken out of his <hi>Somme des Péchez</hi> written in <hi>French. To ſin and be guilty before God, a man muſt know the thing he wou'd do is evil, or, at leaſt, doubt, or fear it; or judge, that God takes no pleaſure in the action he is about, and that he has forbidden it, and, yet notwithſtanding, skip over all rubs and difficulties, go on and commit it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After what I have told you, ſayd the Abbot, of the doctrin, held by all the Jeſuits, it is not difficult, to underſtand the meaning of Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> propoſition. <hi>To ſin,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and make a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:174113:94"/>man guilty in the ſight of God, he must know,</hi> that is to ſay, he muſt not be ignorant by an involuntary ignorance, <hi>that the thing he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do, is not good; at least he muſt doubt it, &amp;c.</hi> how do you prove, ask'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that this was his meaning.</p>
               <p>That, is not my buſineſs nor the Jeſuits, anſwer'd the Abbot; they accuſe them; they give an ill ſenſe to one of their authors propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; their adverſaries, who are the accuſers, ought to convince them and make out their allegations: but I will not be ſo exact with you, nor ſtand upon that formality, ſince it is your deſire I will prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Bauni</hi> teaches, or ſuppoſes, every where, when occaſion offers, that voluntary ignorance, which is call'd <hi>vincible</hi> do's not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe from ſin. This is poſitive, and makes his propoſition blameleſs. Read, ſayd he to 'um, the 775 page of the edition of <hi>la Somme des Péchez,</hi> whence <hi>Paſcal</hi> has taken what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends, and ſee how this Father proves, by Scripture, that voluntary ignorance is blamable. <hi>Such ignorance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.38.</note> ſays he, <hi>is vicious, according to the Apoſtle's ſaying to the Corinthians, ignorans ignorabitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this poſition, <hi>That voluntary ignorance do's not excuſe from ſin,</hi> is ſo indiſputable, continu'd he, and ſo certain among the Divines, that when they treat of the knowledge requiſit to ſin, they do not believe it neceſſary, to advertiſe, that they ſpeak only of the knowledge, which is oppos'd to involuntary ignorance. This is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd clear of it ſelf, and is underſtood in all
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:174113:94"/>the propoſitions, which a thouſand Divines have made, like that of Father <hi>Bauni;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not. in 4, epiſt.</note> and <hi>Wendrok</hi> was never more wicked, or more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in Divinity, than when he argued upon this matter againſt that Jeſuit.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, the reaſon which <hi>Bauni</hi> ſets down for his aſſertion, is, of it ſelf, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to make his meaning known; and this reaſon, is the ſame with Saint <hi>Thomas's,</hi> upon the like occaſion; which is,
<note place="margin">Bauni pag. 906.</note> 
                  <hi>that a man is not to be blamed for any action, that is not voluntary:</hi> theſe are the expreſs termes <hi>Bauni</hi> makes uſe of, immediatly after his propoſition. Whence it only follows, that to ſin a man muſt not be ignorant by an involuntary ignorance, that the action he do's is evil; becauſe, no other igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hinders the action, from being wilful, and by conſequence, according to <hi>Bauni;</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſin. I underſtand this, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and to me his meaning ſeems very plain and manifeſt.</p>
               <p>In the third place, to confound and bring to nothing all the other malicious reflexions, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> and <hi>Wendrok</hi> make upon this doctrin, the Abbot made <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> read, what Father <hi>Bauni</hi> added, preſently after, to explicat the ſame aſſertion. <hi>The will,</hi> ſays he, <hi>carry's it ſelf to, fastens upon, and earneſtly deſires the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden object; which it may do, either formally, or virtually, or very ſilently: formally, when, by an expreſs act, it loves, or hates, embraces, or rejects, what is repreſented to it, by the underſtanding either as good or as bad. It's thought to conſent to it, virtually,</hi> (mind well the following words, ſayd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:174113:95"/>the Abbot) <hi>when the actual and formal conſent, before given, ſtill continues; as we ought to believe it do's, when it is not recal'd, interrupted, or hinder'd by ſome contrary act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee, added he, that to commit a ſin, <hi>Bauni</hi> do's not require an actual reflexion in the very inſtant of ſinning; and that, according to him, it is enuff, this knowledge ſhou'd have preceded, to the end that the inadvertance a man may have, even in the inſtant of acting, may be blamable.</p>
               <p>He alſo ſhew'd the 92 page, where he ſpeaks in this manner. <hi>To ſwear a thing, which even might be true at random, and with the danger of being forſworn for want of having well examin'd it before hand, is a mortal ſin; in as much as that danger is thought voluntary in it's cauſe, which is the ill and pernicious cuſtom of mens ſwearing raſhly, and without heeding what they ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cou'd a Divine, that talks at this rate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the preſent propoſition in this ſenſe, <hi>that, without an actual reflexion, in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of ſinning upon its evil, no man can ever be guilty of a ſin?</hi> it is then evident, that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, naturally, ſignifies nothing elſe, but that to ſin, one muſt know, or at leaſt doubt, whether there be no evil in the action he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that is to ſay, he muſt not be ignorant by an invincible ignorance that it is ſinful.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> by what you have ſayd, that this was the good Father's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But why do not the Caſuiſts take care, not to make ſuch equivocal propoſitions, as
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:174113:95"/>give men a handle to catch at an occaſion to miſconter them? you do not ſufficiently thank me, replied the Abbot, for having taken the pains to prove a thing, which requir'd no proof, and to refute ſo frivolous an accuſation, as that was. However, I have yet patience enuff left, to anſwer, without being angry, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you put me. You know, that in the buſineſs of arts and ſciences, it is the uſage of words, commonly receiv'd among men, of the ſame calling, that takes away equivocation, and determins the ſenſe of a propoſition. Now, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Divines, as I have already given you to underſtand, this uſage, in reference to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent matter, leaves no ambiguity in Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> propoſition; and before the author of <hi>La Theologie Morale</hi> whom <hi>Paſcal</hi> has follow'd, no body had thought of giving any other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than that, which we have given it.</p>
               <p>For, when the Divines diſpute of the nature of ſin, they all ſay, after Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> that to be voluntary is eſſential to ſin; and they explain the definition, and what it is to be voluntary, by the example of the ſins to which this quality do's evidently agree; that is to ſay, by the ſins committed, with a perfect knowledge and a formal reflexion on the evil of the actions. After which, either in anſwering the objections, or otherwiſe, they never fail, to extend this definition to ſome kinds of ſins, to which it do's not agree ſo clearly. Such is Original ſin, which they ſhew to have been, in its, own way, voluntary; ſuch are the ſins, cuſtom
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:174113:96"/>makes us commit by ſurpriſe, without any actual thought; ſuch are the ſins, cauſed by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, which is call'd <hi>vincible;</hi> and it is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this method of Divines, which is the method alſo of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, that Father <hi>Bauni</hi> has defin'd ſin; ſaving, that, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he extends his definition, as he has done in purſuance of what is commonly practis'd in the Schooles, to the other ſorts of ſins, which are voluntary only in their cauſe.</p>
               <p>If this be ſo, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> Father <hi>Bauni</hi> was far from being in the wrong, for explaining himſelf in that manner; but, on the contrary, they were very much out; and ſhew'd a great deal of malice, or of ignorance, who made a buſineſs on't, or objected any thing againſt him upon this account. I will convince you, that this is the common cuſtom, ſayd the Abbot, not by the authority of Jeſuit Divines (they perhaps may be ſuſpected) nor even of the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> or <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> but by the very Theſes of the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> Read this paſſage of the Jeſuits anſwer to <hi>La Theologie Morale</hi> upon this ſubject. Thus the Apologiſt ſpakes <hi>page</hi> 7. <hi>part</hi> 2. I have before me while I am writing this a Theſis defended in <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> in the year 1640, the 3. <hi>October</hi> by one <hi>Peter Bunot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Morel</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, approv'd by Mr. <hi>Forget,</hi> at that time Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic, and Curat of Saint <hi>Nicolas</hi> of <hi>Chardonnet</hi> wherein are theſe words, <hi>Ad omne peccatum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiritur expreſſa cognitio malitiae moralis, vel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſa dubitatio ne actui eliciendo talis malitia mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis inexiſtat.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:174113:96"/>
               <p>Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> propoſition ſeems to be but the tranſlation of this Theſis, which ſays, in Latin, that which he has ſayd in bad <hi>French.</hi> The ſame Apologiſt quotes alſo an other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, exactly like it of Mr. <hi>Du-val</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> adding what is very true, that Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> Saint <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> Saint <hi>Antonin, Gerſon, &amp;c.</hi> ſpeak, in this matter, juſt as <hi>Bauni</hi> has done.</p>
               <p>I find you are ſtrongly provided on this point, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus.</hi> I am yet ſtronger then you imagin, replied the Abbot; I'le appeal to the authority of a Judg, I am ſure you will not refuſe; caſting his eyes, at the ſame time, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhelf, whereon he had eſpied upon his coming in, the writings of an author he was about to quote. I pray, ſayd he to <hi>Cleander,</hi> who ſat near it, reach me down that parchment manuſcript. <hi>Cleander</hi> took it down, and read upon the back of the book, <hi>Traité des péchez dicté en</hi> Sorbonne <hi>par Monſieur de</hi> Sainte-Beuve. Is it poſſible, cry'd out <hi>Cleander,</hi> that Mr. <hi>de Sainte-Beuve</hi> ſhou'd, at this time of day, be Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> ſecurity in this matter?</p>
               <p>The Abbot, who, had ſeen theſe writings, of which there are thouſands of Copies ſpread all over <hi>France,</hi> open'd the place, where he treats of this ſubject, and gives it to <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who began to read, that which follows in Latin. <q>To make an irregular motion in the ſenſual appetit become a mortal ſin,
<note place="margin">Trac. de pecc. diſ. 5. ſec. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:174113:97"/>ſhou'd freely, and knowingly, have given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for that irregular motion or delight. The firſt part is prov'd; becauſe if this adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be but by halv's, the action cannot be perfectly voluntary, as it ought to be, to make it a mortal ſin, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is prov'd, becauſe, if the bare action, the matter it ſelf, and not the evil of it, be but reflected on, then that, which otherwiſe might be criminal in it, not being voluntary, do's not become ſinful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ho! without doubt, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus, Bauni</hi> is now ſafe enuff. I am ſure Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> and all his Party wou'd much rather pardon him, than, with him, condem Mr. <hi>de Sainte-Beuve.</hi> But let us proceed.</p>
               <p>Since you have put me upon the proof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Abbot, I cou'd find in my heart to tire you with my quotations; as indeed I cou'd eaſily do, conſidering the many paſſages I have ready to produce upon this ſubject. But ſince you ask for quarter, I will give it you, upon condition, you'l liſten to one which I muſt needs read you. All its ſtrength and authority depends upon one of Mr. <hi>Arnaulds</hi> beſt friends, a Doctor of <hi>Louvain,</hi> whoſe name and qualities I'le give you an account of, after I have read you his doctrin. Here it is, juſt as I ſaw it in the Theſis, faithfully reported by the author of the book, intitled <hi>L'erreur du Péché Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophique combattuë par les Jéſuites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To ſin mortally, a man muſt have a perfect, intire conſideration, an expreſs knowlege of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:174113:97"/>the ſin, or of the danger there is of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one, or, at leaſt, a formal doubt, or ſome fear, that the action may be ſinful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mind now the reflexion made by the author of the book juſt now cited, addreſſing himſelf to his adverſary. <q>Do you not think, that this was dictated by ſome Jeſuit? and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs do you believe him? it was Doctor <hi>Pontanus,</hi> the famous approver of <hi>Austin</hi> of <hi>Ypres,</hi> whom the Church has condem'd, and of the <hi>Mons</hi> tranſlation of the new Teſtament which he cou'd not underſtand (for he was ignorant of the <hi>French</hi>) it was, I ſay, this <hi>Pontanus</hi> one of the Jeſuits moſt vehement enemies, that ſign'd this Theſis, and preſided when it was defended ...... for, it is one of the ſtatutes of the Univerſity of <hi>Louvain,</hi> that no Doctor ſhou'd approve, or preſide at any Theſis, if any thing be therein contain'd, contrary to the opinion of the Univerſity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We have already more than enuff, ſayd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus;</hi> I pray let the reſt alone; and let us alſo paſs by what <hi>Paſcal</hi> reproches Father <hi>Anat</hi> with: I remember to have read this paſſage in that Jeſuits book; he intended but to ſay, that God commands us nothing that's impoſſible; and if it was to be ſuppos'd, that it was impoſſible for us, without actual grace, to avoid ſin, God wou'd either give us this grace, or elſe wou'd not impute that ſin to us: which doctrin, is contradictory to that which is condem'd in <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius.</hi> This is neither the caſe of Libertins, nor of harden'd ſinners; nor of cuſtomary ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:174113:98"/>nor of thoſe, who ſin by ignorance, or a voluntary inadvertance of their duties. This ſingle paſſage, when I read it, made me think that <hi>Paſcal</hi> was not well able to make this out: ſince to ſupport his cauſe, he was forc'd to have recourſe to ſo weak a proof; and that it was not uſual with Father <hi>Anat,</hi> to miſtake, or ſpeak improperly in matters of Divinity.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, anſwer'd the Abbot, ſee how <hi>Paſcal</hi> triumphs; do but harken to that, which immediatly follows Father <hi>Anat's</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. <q>Ho! how pleas'd I am, ſayd I to him, to perceive what fine conſequences may be drawn from this doctrin. I clearly ſee what will follow; what myſteries do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me. I ſee more men, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, juſtified by this ignorance, and this forgetfulneſs of God, than by Grace and by the Sacraments.</q> What enthuſiaſme, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u'd the Abbot, what viſion, or rather what terrible malice is this?</p>
               <p>Let us here take our leave of Father <hi>Anat,</hi> ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> interrupting him; but let us not yet ſuffer Father <hi>Bauni</hi> to eſcape. I ſee another thing in this Letter, which deſerv's ſome reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it is what <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays, that his book <hi>la Somme des Péchez</hi> was condem'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as by the Biſhops of <hi>France;</hi> and this alſo which <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok</hi> adds, that this propoſition of <hi>Bauni</hi> was formerly cenſur'd in <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had much rather, anſwer'd the Abbot, have to do in this matter with your Janſeniſt, Maſter of this library, than with you. For before I
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:174113:98"/>wou'd anſwer him, or make him take notice of a ſmall touch of Janſenian honeſty in this very paſſage, I ſhou'd ask him what his thoughts were of the cenſure of the <hi>Roman</hi> Inquiſition, whether he wou'd be content, that we ſhou'd, on both ſides, refer our diſputes to this tribunal; if he wou'd, the Jeſuits might freely abandon, or give up <hi>Bauni</hi> to the Inquiſitors ſeverity; but then they wou'd have no farther need to make any Apology or defenſe for themſelves againſt the Provincial Letters, ſince they are all to be ſeen, at large, condem'd, by the decrees of the Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>Ha! what do you ſay, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, it is but two days ſince I read in a letter from one of theſe Gentlemen, on occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Mons</hi> new Teſtament,
<note place="margin">Letter à un Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiller.</note> that <hi>it is very often a mark of the goodneſs of a book to be cenſur'd at</hi> Rome. If this be ſo, ſayd he laughing, <hi>Bauni</hi> and <hi>Paſcal,</hi> far from being confounded, or thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtruck by any ſentence of that Court, cou'd not be blacken'd, or ſo much as wounded in their reputation. It muſt be acknowleg'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd he, that there is ſomething very odd in this buſineſs, and wherein it do's not ſeem to me, that the Janſeniſts pretenſions are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to themſelves, for that a book, made by a Jeſuit, being put into the <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> ſhou'd be ſufficient to make it infamous, but that the putting into it the Provincial Letters and the Teſtament of <hi>Mons,</hi> which tranſlation has been condem'd by two Popes, ſhou'd be a ſign, or teſtimony of their excellency, and make them be the better lik'd, eſteem'd, and valu'd,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:174113:99"/>appears highly improbable; and till better made out, can never be believ'd by men in their ſenſes.</p>
               <p>However it be, anſwer'd the Abbot, they do not much trouble themſelves at <hi>Rome,</hi> in giving the public their reaſons for putting a book into the <hi>Index.</hi> That is ſometimes done, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſome formality in the impreſſion; and ſometimes for aſſerting, or laying down, ſome principles, differing from ſome maxims of the Canoniſts of <hi>Italy,</hi> with whom thoſe of <hi>France</hi> do not always agree; ſomething of this kind there might have been in Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> books, concerning the juriſdiction of the King's Officers over the Clergy; which poſſibly might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd the Inquiſitors, and in reality, 'tis well known, that thoſe, who ſolicited their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, urg'd it upon this motive; even thoſe who daily endeavor, to make themſelves be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd in <hi>France,</hi> by running down the Ultramon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, and pretending themſelves zelous for the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. But, that which is moſt remarkable is, that the Provincial Letters were always look'd upon at <hi>Rome,</hi> as defamatory Libels, full of calumnies and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures; and which is more, full of errors, and, all over, ſtuffed with Janſeniſme. You have nothing now to do, but to gueſs, for which of theſe motives, chiefly, they were condem'd by the Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>As for what relates to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> purſued the Abbot, let us again read <hi>Paſcal's</hi> words. <q>It is ſome prejudice, ſayd my Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt, whiſpering ſoftly in my ear, that this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:174113:99"/>book was condem'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the Biſhops of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q> Wou'd you not believe, ſayd he, turning towards <hi>Cleander,</hi> when <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> book was condem'd by the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> that this muſt have been done, in a National Councel? I conceive, at leaſt, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> according to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that it muſt have been done in an aſſembly of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>No, reply'd the Abbot; all this was no more, but that <hi>Bauni</hi> was cenſur'd by the late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Sens Gondrin,</hi> by the late Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> and by the Biſhop of <hi>Comenges,</hi> who, not many years ſince, died Biſhop of <hi>Tournay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it no more then that, ſayd <hi>Cleander?</hi> this is as if the Emperor ſhou'd make an Imperial decree, or proclamation againſt one of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes, who ſhou'd dare to declare againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange. Bauni</hi> was a Jeſuit, and a great Anti-Janſeniſt, which was ſufficient to make him loſe his cauſe at that bar.</p>
               <p>I will ſay nothing elſe to you of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> continu'd the Abbot, but that it is inconcev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they ſhou'd then cenſure in a Jeſuits book, a propoſition, which they had heard, with reſpect, from the mouth of Mr. <hi>de Sainte-Beuve;</hi> and which they had publicly defended ſome months before, as you have ſeen by the Theſis I have quoted to you; and ſhou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to make Father <hi>Bauni</hi> believe he had taken it in a different ſenſe, from that which is commonly allow'd in Divinity, and which it ought not to have, according to its proper
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:174113:100"/>principles, and which he cou'd not have given it, I do not ſay, without hereſy, but without the greateſt extravagance imaginable. Believe me, in all the wranglings and diſputes they ſo often had in thoſe days with the Society, the Jeſuits labour'd under great difficulties, not ſo much to defend themſelves, but to defend themſelves, with that moderation they always thought themſelves oblig'd to obſerve, even at the expence of their own intereſt, and without being wanting to the reſpect they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew, to ſome communities, or bodys which did not treat them with the ſame kind of reſpect, and of whom ſome particulars had preſs'd hard upon, and puſh'd 'um with the greateſt rage and malice poſſible.</p>
               <p>It is certain, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that the Janſeniſts then ſtudied all the means they cou'd think of, to make all the world fall furiouſly upon the Jeſuits: and they had a wonderful effect; what they inſinuated into ſeveral Communities, do's yet remain in ſome; where great pains are ſtill taken to feed and keep up the humor.</p>
               <p>That is but too true, anſwer'd the Abbot, but let us make an end of examining this Letter; where there is nothing more, particularly relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Jeſuits Morals. Only give me leave, to make in two words a ſhort reflexion among other things, which, of themſelves are obvious enuff, chiefly concerning the malice of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Provincial Letters.</p>
               <p>This reflexion, is upon the great weakneſs of <hi>Paſcal's</hi> whole diſcourſe, upon what, I pray
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:174113:100"/>you, are all theſe conſequences of looſe Morals, in favor of the Libertins, the ungodly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengful, the blaſphemers, and the Epicureans, founded, of which he makes the Jeſuits the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors? they are really built, but upon what he has thought fit, to make his imaginary Jeſuit ſay, touching a neceſſity of an inſpiration from God, and an actual reflexion upon the evil of a wicked action, to make it to become a ſin. All this is grounded, upon the propoſition of Father <hi>Bauni,</hi> and that of Father <hi>Annat,</hi> who never meant what is attributed to 'um. The ſingle diſtinction of ſin, into that which is voluntary of it ſelf, and into that which is but voluntary in its cauſe; and of that which is committed by an invincible, and involuntary ignorance, and that which is committed by the other ignorance, call'd vincible and voluntary, do's quite diſpel and drive away all theſe his frightful phantoms or bugbears.</p>
               <p>By that diſtinction, all <hi>Paſcal's</hi> libertins, all his impudent unchaſt, barefac'd, ſinners and his Epicureans, remain, according to the Jeſuits principles, guilty and convicted of all the crimes, from which he pretends theſe Divines have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd them. The little I have explain'd to you of their Divinity, has made all this clear, and palpable; and yet nevertheleſs, it is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, that in all the ſpecious, fine accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the hereſy of the philoſophic ſin, (which was look'd upon at firſt as a thunderbolt, that wou'd have cruſh'd and broken the Jeſuits to pieces, thô all of a ſudden it fell and came to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:174113:101"/>nothing) men ſhou'd be refer'd to the fourth Provincial Letter, as to a writing, that contain'd an evident demonſtration of the matter of fact, after which the Jeſuits ought not to be allow'd or admitted, to make any defenſe or excuſe for themſelves, of which I leave you to judge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> interrupting him, to do you a pleaſure, I'le repeat to you, what I heard a very judicious man at that time ſay. He had newly read the Jeſuits ſecond Letter, and the book you cited a little while ago, <hi>L'er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reur du peché philoſophique,</hi> &amp;c. he ſayd he wou'd laugh no more, nor take any farther delight in the pleaſanteries of the fourth Provincial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but yet wou'd make himſelf amends, by reading the ſerious and vehement accuſations of the new hereſy of the philoſophic ſin; at every article of which Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> made him laugh more than once. His reaſon was, that the Jeſuits had demonſtrated two things in theſe books; firſt, that none of their Divines ever doubted but the ungodly, the libertins, and the cuſtomary ſinners, were guilty of ſin, and ought to be eternally puniſh'd for thoſe very crimes, which they commit with leaſt remorſe and moſt quiet. Secondly, that the contrary cannot be infer'd, or prov'd from their principles; ſince it is certain, they all hold, not one excepted, that neither ignorance, nor inadvertance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blindneſs, nor cuſtom, when wilful, can excuſe ſinners, or hinder them from incurring the penalties of Hell, the due reward, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence of their ill actions.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:174113:101"/>two matters of fact, ſayd he, which the Jeſuits have clearly prov'd, and ſo as to convince all the world, deſtroys the whole appearance of any probability, in the pleaſant things ſayd in the fourth Provincial Letter; and, conſequently, leav's them inſipid, without ſalt, and without wit. For there is nothing flatter, than raillery without a cauſe, a jeſt, without the leaſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of truth, or reaſon, which therefore all men of ſenſe have in horror and indignation.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon, the anger, and ſometimes the fury of Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> in his five accuſations of the Jeſuits, for the philoſophic ſin, make men as often as they read them, ask what this good man wou'd be at? he has in hands, the the Profeſſor of <hi>Dijon's</hi> writings, as he himſelf tells us, he has no more to do but to read them. This Profeſſor himſelf has publiſh'd them, and by good proofs made them authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; to the end the whole world might be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the purity of his ſaith, and of his opinions. The Jeſuits condem'd the expreſſion in his Theſis, and own'd there was reaſon to contradict him. They cry out, and tell Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> that he makes objections, and ſprites for himſelf to anſwer and frighten away; that except the opinion of involuntary ignorance, which excuſes from ſin, hardly any thing of the reſt, is either a concluſion, or a principle of their Divines: this they urge, and this they do indeed demonſtrate. At that time, I believ'd this matter but by halv's, continu'd <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> but I am now as fully perſuaded of it, ſayd he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:174113:102"/>to the Abbot, as you your ſelf can be. Let us therefore proceed to the fifth Letter.</p>

                  <head>The following part of the fifth Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <p>WE have diſpatch'd, ſayd the Abbot, in our former Dialogues, a good part of what is handled in this fifth Letter; of which the main ſubject, is the doctrin of probability. There remain only ſome particular caſes to be examin'd; the firſt, that offers it ſelf, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> laughing, is a ſmall matter, nothing, in a manner; he only reproches the Jeſuits, that, with a ſubtile direction of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they permit the Chriſtians of <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> to commit Idolatry. Let us read it, it is at the 75 <hi>page</hi> of my edition. <q>By this means they have (Directors) for all ſorts of perſons; and anſwer ſo well, according to what is demanded of them, that when they are in countrys, where a crucified God paſſes for folly, they ſuppreſs the ſcandal of the croſs, and only preach a glorious, and not a ſuffering Jeſus; as they have done in <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Indies;</hi> where they have allow'd the Chriſtians to commit, even, Idolatry, by that ſubtile invention of making them hide, under their garments, the image of our Savior; to which they teach them to refer, mentally, their public adorations of the Idol, <hi>Chacin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choan,</hi> and of <hi>Keum-fucum;</hi> as <hi>Gravina</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican</hi> reproches them, and as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> memorial preſented to <hi>Philip</hi> the IV King of

                  </p>
                  <p>I do profeſs to you, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that theſe things are ſo very ſurprizing, the heads of the accuſation ſo black, and alſo far fetch'd, that I had always much ado, to believe them true, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the report of the authors of <hi>la Morale-pratique.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ha! why not, anſwer'd the Abbot; are you alſo as hard to be perſuaded of theſe other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious particularities? That the Jeſuits were the cauſe of the perſecution in <hi>Japon;</hi> which was always attributed to the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and that it was not the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but the Jeſuits, who made the Kings of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japon</hi> believe, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monks endevor'd to get a footing in thoſe countrys, for no other end, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> that the Jeſuits
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:174113:103"/>did not only croſs and drive away the other Miſſioners, but alſo perſecute them to death. That it was public all over <hi>Spain,</hi> that they had thrice poyſon'd a Doctor,
<note place="margin">Morale pratique. tom 1. pag. 209.</note> call'd <hi>John Eſpino,</hi> and committed a thouſand other ſuch peccadillos, of which they aſſure us they make no more ſcruple, than <hi>French</hi> high way men wou'd do.</p>
                  <p>You railly, Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him; well then, anſwer'd he, let us ſpeak ſeriouſly. I ſay, if all theſe fine things, which they tell us, are true, the Popes, the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> are a thouſand times more to be blam'd, than the Jeſuits. For 'tis to them, that all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, all theſe memorials, and all theſe peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Society were made: and, yet notwithſtanding all this, theſe Popes, and theſe Kings, inſenſible of the intereſt of the Church and of their States, ſend the Jeſuits to <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Indies:</hi> pray, and preſs them, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the harveſts, that are there; althô they are every day told, that they ſpoil and ruin them: and which is more, they exhort 'um to continue and to behave themſelves, as hitherto they have done; expreſſing, on all occaſions, how much they are ſatisfied with their conduct.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII, under whom the informers began to tell their ſtories in <hi>Rome,</hi> declared himſelf in his Bull, directed to the Chriſtians of <hi>Japon,</hi> in the year 1626. And <hi>Alexander</hi> VII in 1655, writing to the Empereſs <hi>Helena,</hi> the wife of <hi>Yum-lié,</hi> at that time, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of ſome of the Provinces of <hi>China,</hi> and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:174113:103"/>in a decree of the year 1656, expreſly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the Jeſuits proceedings in <hi>China. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> IX, in an other decree, in 1669, confirms that of his Predeceſſor.
<note place="margin">3. Dee, 1681.</note> 
                     <hi>Innocent</hi> XI did the ſame in what he writ to the famous Father <hi>Verbieſt,</hi> and afterwards in an other letter to the Chriſtians of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> when he ſent them back the Jeſuits, as they had, for a long time, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired:
<note place="margin">7. Ian. 1689. 25. Iuly. 1690. and 2. Sep. 1691.</note> and as did alſo <hi>Alexander</hi> VIII and <hi>Innocent</hi> XII in their Bulls to the Emperor of <hi>China.</hi> Wherein the firſt gave great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the Jeſuits, and the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd all his Predeceſſor had ſayd in their favor.</p>
                  <p>This is for certain very ſtrong, Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> but a little too general: let us come to the matter of fact. The Decree of 1646, and the allowance of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me, anſwer'd the Abbot, a little briſkly, that all I have ſayd to you comes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly enuff to this matter of fact; and that, without much arguing, it is eaſy to conclude, by the Popes, and Kings of <hi>Spain's</hi> proceeding, by their Bulls, and Decrees, that all, which has been ſayd upon this ſubject againſt the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, are mere, perfect, calumnies; and that, if their enemies cou'd produce as ſtrong proofs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as thoſe I have alledg'd for their juſtification, we ſhou'd ſoon ſee finer declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them, than thoſe wherewith they have already fill'd ſix or ſeven tomes of the <hi>Morale-pratique.</hi> But this is the fate of theſe Fathers; ſome whimſical, chimerical, viſion of any one of their enemies, or a popular report,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:174113:104"/>rais'd, God knows how, is enuff to blacken them; and yet to acquit and vindicat their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, the authentic acts muſt always be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. A hundred years hence, the Bombs of <hi>Namur,</hi> will be a matter of fact, altogether as clear, and certain, in the annals of ſome <hi>Port-Royal</hi> man of that time, as the Gun-powder treaſon in <hi>England</hi> is, in the accounts of the Proteſtants of that Iſland. Yet, ſince you will have it ſo, let us come to this fine paſſage of <hi>Paſcal;</hi> upon which I will make you ſome ſhort remarks, which I will juſtify and make good, either here or at home.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as touching this decree, mention'd in the Provincial Letters, <hi>Paſcal</hi> muſt needs have ſpoken without book; and neither he, nor thoſe who engaged him to write, ever ſaw or read it; there was no decree made by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paganda</hi> on this ſubject in 1646. but in 1645. nor was it dated in the month of <hi>July,</hi> but in the month of <hi>September,</hi> nor ſigned by Cardinal <hi>Caponi,</hi> but by Cardinal <hi>Ginetti;</hi> and thus all theſe little circumſtances, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> affects to ſet down ſo exactly, to gain himſelf more credit, ſerve but to make his teſtimony the more ſuſpicious, as coming from a man, very ill inform'd, who writes at random, and upon the credit of very uncertain memorials.</p>
                  <p>But from theſe ſimple falſities, let us go on to calumnies. Not one of thoſe, who reads this paſſage of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> but thinks the Jeſuits were heard and convicted of all theſe crimes, in a full congregation, and condem'd by a decree,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:174113:104"/>and afterwards admoniſh'd, and oblig'd to change their practiſe, in the inſtruction of their Proſelites, and new Converts, and forc'd, more eſpecially, to make them deteſt Idolatry, and the adorations they had allow'd of to <hi>Chachin-Choam</hi> and <hi>Keum-fucum,</hi> or <hi>Confucius;</hi> and, yet notwithſtanding, there is nothing more falſe; and ſince you deſire the particularities I pray harken to the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>After the Miſſioners of other Orders went into <hi>China,</hi> ſeveral memorials againſt the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, were ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the ſubject we now diſcourſe of; but more eſpecially, among others, two. The firſt, was from two Biſhops of the <hi>Philippin</hi> Iſlands, and the other, from a <hi>Dominican</hi> Miſſioner, call'd <hi>John Baptiſt Morales.</hi> The Biſhops memorial did not give the Jeſuits any long trouble; for, ſome time after,
<note place="margin">In 1633.</note> theſe two Prelats writ to the Pope, that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the contrary, of what they had writ before upon falſe relations, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in Conſcience, to juſtify the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society, againſt ſo unjuſt accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to defend with all their might, the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of theſe Fathers, as well as the truth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Morales</hi> did not forbear propoſing his difficulties to the Congregation, of which theſe following were two. <hi>Whether it were lawful to prostrate before the Idol</hi> Chin-choam <hi>and to offer Sacrifice to</hi> Confucius. The Jeſuits, who very well ſaw, that theſe queſtions were made in prejudice to them, had nothing to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with, to the world, but the <hi>Philippin</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:174113:105"/>Biſhops retractation. I ſay to the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Congregation, without ſummoning them, was content, themſelves, to anſwer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Morales's</hi> queſtions; in the greateſt part whereof, no more than in theſe, there was no manner of difficulty. Hereupon follow'd a decree of the Pope; wherein the anſwers of the Congregation were approv'd, and a prohibition made of proceeding otherwiſe in <hi>China,</hi> than according to thoſe anſwers: one of which was, that it was unlawful, to Sacrifice to <hi>Confucius.</hi> This prohibition then, was, not particular to the Jeſuits, as <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays, (and that is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circumſtance of the calumny) but to all Miſſioners in genearl, and in particular, of whatſoever order, profeſſion, or inſtitution, they were of. <hi>Omnibus &amp; ſingulis Miſſionarijs cujuſcunque, Ordinis, Religionis, &amp; Instituti;</hi> and to the Jeſuits alſo, <hi>etiam Societatis Jeſu.</hi> This is the form of the ſtile, they have, for a long time, uſed in all decrees, relating to Religious Orders: and all this as the decree go's on, till the Pope, or the holy See, ſhall otherwiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; <hi>Donec Sanctitas ſua, vel ſancta Sedes aliud ordinaverit.</hi> Words, which, of themſelves, do plainly ſhew, that the holy See deſir'd to be more particularly inform'd of the matter of fact. for as to the matter of right, there was no ground, or pretence for another review, or deliberation; eſpecially touching the pretended Sacrifice offer'd to <hi>Confucius.</hi> This thing ſpeaks of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And his Holineſs afterwards was better and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:174113:105"/>more effectually inform'd; for, ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Father <hi>Martini</hi> the Jeſuit, being come from <hi>China</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> fully acquainted both the Pope and the Congregation, with the whole affair; and how all that had given occaſion, for the ſuſpicion of Idolatry, was but ſome certain ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, made at the reception of Doctors, in honor of <hi>Confucius,</hi> which are purely civil, and have no manner of relation to Religion; and that there was no Sacrifice, nor any thing like it. Whereupon the Congregation made an other decree, in favor of the Jeſuits, in the year 1656, of which without doubt the author of the Provincial Letters, or his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors wou'd not have really been, or ſeem'd to be ignorant, if it had been, but as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, as it was for, the advantage of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whoſe innocence was thereby fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd; and after which, all other Morals, but thoſe of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> wou'd have oblig'd <hi>Paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I have drawn it out of the ſpring head, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd he, out of the moſt authentic pieces that can be had of ſuch a matter; and perhaps we ſhall find them here, or, at leaſt, extracts of them. If your Janſeniſt be as curious, as you ſay he is, he will have, with all the tomes of the <hi>Morale-Pratique,</hi> the works of a Jeſuit, who
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:174113:106"/>has refuted ſome part of them; for, in theſe kind of diſputes, men ſeldom fail, to have what is writ, on both ſides, pro and con.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot went to the ſhelf, where the tomes of <hi>la Morale-Pratique</hi> ſtood, and thereon found the book intitl'd, <hi>Défenſe des nouveaux Chreſtiens &amp; des Miſſionnaires de la</hi> Chine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhew'd to <hi>Eudoxus</hi> in this book,
<note place="margin">1. part. pag. 196. 2. edit.</note> the extracts of moſt part of the pieces, which prov'd what he had newly ſayd, and particularly the extract of the decree of 1656. where he made him chiefly obſerve, that which here follows relating to the pretended adorations of <hi>Conſucius.</hi>

                     <p>I Brother <hi>Dominic Marie Serpetri,</hi> otherwiſe call'd of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> by nation a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> of the Order of the Friers Preachers formerly approv'd, for a Maſter, or Teacher of Divinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do certify all, who ſhall ſee theſe Letters; firſt, that being ſent by the Superiors of the Province of the <hi>Roſary</hi> of the <hi>Philippines</hi> of my Order, to Preach the Goſpel in the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> and having apply'd my ſelf, by the command of the ſame Superiors, with all poſſible care, for the ſpace of eight years, to examin the ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Sects, I am perſuaded, that the practiſe of the Jeſuit Miſſioners in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in permitting, or tolerating ſome cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, uſed by the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Chriſtians in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Philoſopher <hi>Confucius,</hi> and their deceaſed anceſtors; that their conduct is, I ſay, not only without danger of ſin, being
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:174113:108"/>approv'd by the Congregation of the General Inquiſition, but, alſo conſidering the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the chief Sects of <hi>China,</hi> that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is more probable than the contrary, and otherwiſe very uſeful, not to ſay neceſſary, to open for the Infidels a gate to the Goſpel....</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I do certify, that the Jeſuit Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have declar'd and preach'd, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>China,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt crucifi'd; and this not only by word of mouth, but alſo by a great number of books, which they have made: that they do explain to their new Converts, with a great deal of care and pains, the myſteries of the Paſſion; that in ſome places of theſe Fathers Reſidence, there are Confraternities of the Paſſion; and that, very lately, the perſecuter of our holy faith, <hi>Yam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam-ſien</hi> extremely reproch'd the Preachers of the Goſpel, with adoring a man crucifi'd, for the God of heaven and earth; and all this he prov'd out of the books written by the Jeſuits.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hold a little, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> interrupting him, till I do compare this with what is ſayd in the Provincial Letters. <hi>They anſwer ſo well, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is demanded, that in countrys, where a crucified God paſſes for folly, they ſuppreſs the ſcandal of the Croſs, and only preach a glorious, not a ſuffering Jeſus; as they have done in</hi> China, <hi>and the</hi> Indies. Go on now if you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>In the third place; I certify, and, as far as is requiſit, do proteſt, with an oath, that I have not been prevail'd upon, by the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or perſuaſions of any man whatever, but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:174113:108"/>only by the meer love of truth, to give this double certificat or teſtimonial ..... for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to underſtand, on occaſion of ſome doubts propos'd, in 1645, to the ſacred Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Father <hi>John Baptiſt Morales,</hi> a man truly Apoſtolical, and actuated by a Chriſtian zeal, that ſome men, ill inclin'd to the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had publiſh'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that the Miſſioners in <hi>China,</hi> did not preach Chriſt crucifi'd, and that they allow'd their Chriſtians to commit Idolatry, being hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on afraid, that I ſhou'd ſeem by my ſilence to approve the calumnies of thoſe people, and being alſo deſirous to repair, to the utmoſt of my power, the injur'd reputation of thoſe Fathers, I reſolv'd to declare my opinion in the foreſaid manner, ſubmitting it, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to a more infallible judgment, to wit to that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In witneſs whereof, I have writ this letter with my own hand, in the houſe of the <hi>Canton,</hi> where we are kept priſoners and in exile, this fourth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1688.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ha! what can be added to this, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> very much ſurpris'd? But do you know, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that the author of the Apology, or <hi>la deffenſe des nouveaux Chretiens,</hi> &amp;c. invites any, who ſhou'd ſcruple the truth of the pieces he has cited, to come and ſee them in the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits College at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the originals, or very authentic and undoubted copies are kept? And do you alſo know, that I my ſelf have ſatisfi'd my own curioſity in this matter? what,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:174113:109"/>ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> have you then read the book, and ſeen the pieces he quotes? tell me ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what you think of them?</p>
                  <p>The judgment I make of this book, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> is, that it is an excellent piece, folid, inſtructive, well writ, and becauſe of the variety of its matter, very diverting: it is, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, very modeſt, and comes from a man, who knows how to contain himſelf upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion where the bare reading of what he writes often rais'd in me an indignation againſt thoſe he confutes. The heinouſneſs and enormity of the crimes impos'd upon the Jeſuits, and the evidence of the matters of fact, and of the proofs by which he demonſtrates their falſity, produces ſeveral different emotions in the minds of the readers, which invite and oblige them to a conſtant attention; and yet nevertheleſs, the author, with all his moderation, has let no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſlip, which the matter cou'd furniſh him with againſt his adverſaries. In one word, this Apology, do's not only deſtroy all theſe black calumnies, we now diſcourſe of, and which have been ſo far fetch'd, but alſo begets a prejudice againſt thoſe, who have maliciouſly undertaken to ſpread and improve them in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and, for my own part, I can truly ſay, that nothing has made me more diſtruſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters, than this book.</p>
                  <p>I will find a time to read it, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> to ſatisfy my ſelf, and to gratify Mr. Abbot, who, certainly, can have nothing more to add to what you have ſayd. I cou'd yet, obſerve to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:174113:109"/>you, anſwer'd Mr. Abbot, an other falſity of <hi>Paſcal's</hi> in this place we are now examining: and that is, what he ſays of the Jeſuits permitting Idolatry, not only in <hi>China,</hi> but in the <hi>Indies</hi> alſo; which is more than ever was objected by any of their calumniators; who always confin'd themſelves to <hi>China:</hi> and they had good reaſon not to extend their reproches to the <hi>Indies;</hi> which had they done, the impoſture wou'd have been much more eaſily diſcover'd. Neither <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor <hi>Portugaiſe,</hi> neither <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor <hi>Hollanders,</hi> traded in <hi>China;</hi> whereas all theſe Nations drive a trade in the <hi>Indies;</hi> from whence the Jeſuits might have had as many witneſſes of their innocence as there were Merchants.</p>
                  <p>It is however, convenient to remark one thing, as we go along, and that is, that the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of Idolatry in <hi>Japon,</hi> wou'd have been much more neceſſary for the Jeſuits than in <hi>China.</hi> For, after all, the perſecutions which they ſuffer'd in this great Empire, were more than either baniſhment, or impriſonment; whereas in <hi>Japon,</hi> they were almoſt always in continual hazard of their lives. Near upon a hundred Jeſuits there Martyr'd, ſome by the dreadful torment of water, others, by being buried alive, and ſome, by being burnt by little and little, might, eaſily have freed themſelves by directing mentally their adorations to a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, hid under their habits, whilſt they ſeem'd openly to make them to Idols, as, is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they allow their new Converts to do in the Temples of <hi>China.</hi> For ſurely, they ought
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:174113:110"/>to be allow'd to have wit enuff <hi>To let Charity,</hi> according to the Proverb, <hi>begin at home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ha! what, Mr. Abbot, muſt I help you out in this matter, and make, upon this paſſage, an other important obſervation, which you have forgot? the main piece, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> cites, for a proof of the Jeſuits Idolatry in <hi>China,</hi> is, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> memorial preſented, as is ſayd, to <hi>Philip</hi> the IV, King of <hi>Spain</hi> by the Cordeliers of the <hi>Philippin</hi> Iſlands; which writing you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member was ſuppos'd, and falſly attributed to theſe Religious, to give it more authority: the true author not daring to publiſh it under his own name. This author was one <hi>Diego Collado,</hi> who, before, had made uſe of ſuch kind of artifices, in other Satyres of this nature; an unquiet, troubleſom fellow, convicted, like an other <hi>Oates,</hi> of an infinity of contradictions, and impoſtures; wherewith his memorials are fill'd, and to whom ſufficient juſtice has been done, in the very hiſtory of his own Order; which recounts the many great troubles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances he had occaſion'd among them. The Jeſuit Father, who ſhew'd me the pieces, that are already inſerted, or yet to be, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of their Miſſions, gave me an account of this particular thing, and ſhew'd it me in the hiſtory of <hi>China,</hi> writ in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> by <hi>Navaret,</hi> an other <hi>Dominican,</hi> and a moſt obſtinat accuſer of the Jeſuits, whilſt he continued in his Order. But, being afterwards made an Archbiſhop, he became their great commender, their Patron, and their friend: his friendſhip and eſteem was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:174113:110"/>ſo very great, that he founded them a College in Saint <hi>Domingo,</hi> the Archiepiſcopal City.</p>
                  <p>Really, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> this is not the leaſt conſiderable point of your animadverſions, upon this firſt article of the fifth Provincial Letter: but it is hard, I confeſs, to make a more ſolid remark.</p>
                  <p>The matter deſerv'd the pains I have taken, anſwer'd the Abbot; this article of Idolatry, is, for the Jeſuits, the moſt cruel paſſage of all the Provincial Letters; and I have often told them, that it was, in ſome meaſure, the deciſive point of all the reſt: for, this being once ſuppos'd true, all that follows wou'd be taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; at leaſt wou'd not appear incredible. But, the falſhood of it being once clearly prov'd and made out, the obſtinat rage and malice of the Society's enemies, wou'd be evidently ſeen, to the ſcandal and indignation of all good men. The examination, continued he, of the other particular articles in this Letter of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not ſo much diſcuſſion; which we ſhall therefore ſoon run over.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> caſes about faſting, ſayd <hi>Cleander;</hi> here they are, look upon them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the fine preface of the twenty four old men, and the four animals: let us read this paſſage in <hi>Paſcal;</hi> it is really pleaſant enuff. <q>
                        <hi>He, who cannot ſleep, if he do's not eat his Supper, ought he to faſt? no by no means.</hi> Are you not ſatisfy'd? not altogether, ſays I to him, for I can faſt very well, by making my Collation in the morning, and eating my
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:174113:111"/>Supper at night. See what follows, ſayd he to me; they did not fail to conſider every thing. <hi>And what wou'd they ſay, if one cou'd be content, without any Collation in the morning, to Sup only in the evening.</hi> To this it is anſwer'd, <hi>That notwithſtanding a man is not bound to faſt; for no body is oblig'd to change his ordinary courſe of eating.</hi> Oh what excellent reaſon, ſayd I, is this!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is very ridiculous, anſwer'd the Abbor, and it muſt be ingenuouſly confeſt, that <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> who is not always ſo much <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> that is to ſay, in the Janſeniſts language, ſo looſe, as theſe Gentlemen wou'd have the world believe, it, muſt be acknowledg'd, ſayd he, that he very well deſerv'd to be raillyed for this his fine deciſion. I my ſelf condem him for it; I only add; that <hi>Eſcobar</hi> did not learn this anſwer, as far as I can underſtand, either from the four animals, <hi>Suarez, Vaſquez, Molina,</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> or the twenty four old men; and, alſo, that the good man was miſtaken (as he often is) in quoting, for his opinion, <hi>Filiucius,</hi> who in his treatiſe of faſting ſays nothing like it. I am much pleas'd with you Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> I perceive your downright honeſty, and do very much commend you for it. As for my ſelf, I cannot endure ſome of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits friends, who, right or wrong, will defend them in every thing. Can they think, that when men put on the habit of the Society, they with it alſo put on, as if it were another garment, the guift of infallibility?</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:174113:111"/>
                  <p>Thoſe friends, anſwer'd the Abbot, wou'd perhaps ſhew the ſame moderation, that I do, if their enemies had as much juſtice and equity as you. Both run to extremities; but the laſt are more to be blam'd than the firſt. As for the other queſtions, about faſting, continued he, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> calls diverting, if he wou'd but have taken the pains to read Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in his fourth book of ſentences,
<note place="margin">Diſt. 15. q. 3. a. 4.</note> he might be ſure to find many more ſuch to divert himſelf with.</p>
                  <p>They are not very material, ſayd <hi>Cleander;</hi> but how will you anſwer what he charges <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> with; that to drink wine, out of meales, and even ſeveral times do's not break faſt?</p>
                  <p>Reach me hither (I pray you) Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> Sum, ſayd the Abbot to <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> wherein he read to them the 147 queſtion of the <hi>ſecunda ſecundae</hi> art. 6. where the Saint thus teaches; <q>the queſtion, in the title is, whether the command of faſting, obliges a man, to make but one meal; <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trum requiratur ad jejunium quod homo ſemel tantùm comedat.</hi> He makes this objection; thoſe who faſt are not forbid to drink, ſeveral times, at ſeveral hours of the day, they are not therefore forbid to make more meals than one. <hi>Non eſt prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum quin pluries bibamus diverſis horis diei: ergo etiam non debet eſſe prohibitum jejunantibus quin pluries comedant.</hi> He anſwers, that the faſting, enjoyn'd by the Church, is not broken, but by thoſe things, which at the inſtitution of the faſt, ſhe had an intention to prohibit; but ſhe had no intention to command abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:174113:112"/>from drink; and by conſequence it is lawful, for thoſe, who faſt, to drink ſeveral times a day. <hi>Et ideo licet pluries jejunantibus bibere</hi> ..... that if a man do's not drink mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly, he ſins and loſes the merit, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, of faſting, as he alſo do's, who makes but one meal, and eats not moderatly. <hi>Si quis autem immoderatè potu utatur, poteſt peccare, &amp; meritum jejunij perdere; ſicut etiam, ſi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatè cibum in unâ comeſtione aſſumat.</hi>
                     </q> It is Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> who thus ſpeaks, continu'd the Abbot, not <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> and his opinion is follow'd by a multitude of Divines.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing more to ſay, anſwer'd <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Eſcobar</hi> is very ſafe, his ſecurity is beyond exception. But, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> at leaſt, declares, that if a man ſhou'd drink too often on a faſting day, he wou'd be guilty of the ſin of intemperance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſcal,</hi> anſwer'd the Abbot, who omits none of the circumſtances, that might make <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> deciſion appear looſe to thoſe who are ignorant of Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> opinion, takes great care to add, whatever cou'd reſtrain it. Liſten then to <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> who, in this matter, is but Saint <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's</hi> Echo, <hi>This do's not hinder,</hi> ſayd he, <hi>but that if you be not moderat in your drinking, you may commit a ſin againſt temperance, althô you do not commit one againſt the precept of faſting. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatio autem poteſt temperantiam violare ſed non jejunium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ho ho! ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> if <hi>Paſcal</hi> had but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated theſe words alſo of the Caſuiſt, they
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:174113:112"/>wou'd have turn'd all the edge of his wit, or rather have left him no room for any; this wou'd have made all his jeſts and raillery about the hypocras, appear very dull and inſipid, and <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> whom he deſign'd to make ridiculous, cou'd not poſſibly have been laugh'd at. Here follows <hi>Filiucius</hi> upon the ſame ſubject, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Cleander;</hi> which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made his Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit thus tranſlate. <q>
                        <hi>Is he, that has tir'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſome action, as by purſuing a wench, oblig'd to faſt? no, by no means; but if he have tir'd himſelf, on purpoſe to be thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd from faſting, ſhall he, notwithſtanding, be bound to faſt? althô this ſhou'd have been his deſign, yet ſhall he not be oblig'd to faſt. Ho! very well,</hi> cou'd you poſſibly have believ'd this, ſayd he to me; truly Father, ſays I to him, I can hardly yet believe it. Ho what! is it not a ſin for a man, not to faſt when he is able? and is it lawful to ſeek occaſion for ſinning, or rather are we not oblig'd to avoid them? that wou'd be very convenient; not always, ſayd he to me, but according.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us read <hi>Filiucius</hi> himſelf, ſayd the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot; who having found the paſſage quoted, pray'd them to paſs by <hi>Paſcal's</hi> tranſlation for a moment, and harken to his. <q>
                        <hi>Dices ſecundo, an qui malo fine laboraret, ut ad aliquem occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum, vel ad inſequendam amicam, vel quid ſimile, teneretur ad jejunium? You will put me a ſecond queſtion, to wit, whether a man who had wearied himſelf, in proſecution of ſome ill deſign, as by endevoring to kill his adverſary, or by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:174113:113"/>running after his mistres, or by ſome ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhou'd be oblig'd to faſt.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Reſpondeo talem quidem peccaturum ex malo fine: at ſecutâ defatigatione excuſaretur à jejunio. I anſwer, that this man's evil end wou'd make him guilty of ſin, but yet, ſuppoſing him quite ſpent and tired, he cou'd not be oblig'd to fast. Ita</hi> Medina, <hi>niſi fieret in fraudem ſecundum aliquos: It is the opinion of</hi> Medina, <hi>if it be not done on purpoſe, to avoid faſting as ſome Divines do ſay. Sed melius alij culpam quidem eſſe in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponenda cauſa fractionis jejunij, at eâ poſitâ excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari à jejunio. Ita</hi> Antoninus, Medina, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter. <hi>But others ſay better, that the ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in a man's putting himſelf into a condition not to be able to faſt; but that being in ſuch condition he is freed from the obligation of faſting. This is the opinion of Saint</hi> Antonin, Medina <hi>and</hi> Sylveſter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ha what! ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> if to the end I might not faſt to morrow, I ſhou'd get my ſelf blooded to day, both in my arms and in my feet, ſo much as to make me faint, wou'd <hi>Paſcal,</hi> notwithſtanding, condem me to faſt to morrow? I believe if he were my phyſician, and did not hinder me, that he himſelf would be guilty of ſin. I conceive, as <hi>Filiucius</hi> ſayd, that I my ſelf ſhou'd commit a very grievous ſin, by propoſing to my ſelf ſuch an end, and that to have put my ſelf into a diſability of faſting, wou'd be a ſin, twice as great, as the ſingle ſin of not faſting, cou'd, otherwiſe have been. But, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if I were in this condition, I ſhou'd not believe my ſelf oblig'd, even, to ask a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from the Curat.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:174113:113"/>
                  <p>I leave you, ſayd the Abbot, to compare my tranſlation with <hi>Paſcals's;</hi> and alſo the deciſion of <hi>Filiucius,</hi> Saint <hi>Antonin</hi> and others, with the notion, or idea he gives of it, in his captious way of propoſing the matter. Thouſands of people, who read theſe Letters, only, to divert themſelves, and who depended upon what <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> ſayd, have treated this Divine, as ridiculous, impertinent, extravagant, and a corrupter of Morals: but you ſee with what juſtice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, <hi>Filiucius</hi> had made uſe of two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to explain his meaning; one of which, had nothing in it offenſive; <hi>Paſcal</hi> paſſes this by, and lays hold of the other, which, put into <hi>French,</hi> ſeems not very modeſt or decent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>Latin,</hi> and in theſe ſort of books which are never read by the common people, nor by Lay-men, the thing, is, in it ſelf, indifferent, and very far from being ill: there appears in all this proceeding a great deal of affected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. But what ſay you to the conſequences he draws from this deciſion, and the inſtances he puts to the good Father he is in diſcourſe with? <q>Ho what! ſayd he, is it not a ſin not to faſt, when one is able? is it lawful to ſeek occaſions of ſinning, or rather are we not oblig'd to fly and avoid them?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that all this, is flat and dull enuff, and wicked in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. <hi>Wendrok,</hi> in defending <hi>Paſcal,</hi> added <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> ſtruggles hard, and in a very ſtrange manner, to bring him off, from this unlucky buſineſs. Upon this occaſion, one told me,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:174113:114"/>but t'other day, that in all places <hi>Wendrok</hi> rail'd againſt the Jeſuits like a Carter, but in this, he curs'd and ſwore like a bog'd Carter; and yet, notwithſtanding all, he ſtill ſtuck faſt where he was plung'd very deep in the mud. The compariſon is not very neat or cleanly, but yet it very fully expreſſes the matter.</p>
                  <p>The farther we go, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the more I ſuſpect, that the books of the Society's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts, are not ſo fertil of monſtrous deciſions, as the Janſeniſts, and thoſe, who believe, or ſeem to believe them, do every where publiſh. For, if they are to be met in ſuch crowds, why do they chooſe thoſe the Jeſuits are able to juſtify by the very bare expoſition of the text; and that in ſuch a manner, as common ſenſe muſt bear them witneſs they have taken it right? why do they give them occaſion to cry out againſt impoſtures? why do they furniſh them with matter for the juſt complaints they have ſo often made, that they falſify the texts of their authors, to make themſelves ſport, and turn them into ridicule, to give their readers a malicious kind of pleaſure? you ſhall ſee more examples, than one of this ſort, anſwer'd the Abbot; but let us now look back, and read the remainder of this Dialogue.</p>
                  <p>See, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> here is the place we broke off at. <q>Is it lawful to ſeek for an occaſion of ſinning? not always, ſayd he to me, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording; according to what ſayd I. Ho ho! anſwer'd the Father, and if they ſhou'd ſuffer ſome inconvenience by ſhunning the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:174113:114"/>are they, in your opinion, oblig'd to avoid them? but this, at leaſt, is not Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> opinion, as you may ſee <hi>page</hi> 1084. <hi>Abſolution ought not to be refus'd to thoſe, who continue in the near occaſions of ſinning; if they are in ſuch a condition, as not to be able to quit them, without giving the world occaſion to diſcourſe, or without receiving ſome great inconvenience by it themſelves.</hi>
                     </q> Father I am mightily pleas'd at this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who, at the ſame time, read in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bauni's</hi> book, the place quoted by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> ſayd to <hi>Cleander,</hi> interrupting him, I do not find it ſo here; nor do's <hi>Bauni</hi> make mention of the <hi>near occaſion</hi> of ſinning; and this is an eſſential falſification, the contrary is expreſly ſet down. <q>
                        <hi>For as much,</hi> ſayd he, <hi>as that the cauſe, which inclines and carry's a man to evil, is not of it ſelf bad, nor contrary to any precept, or Eccleſiaſtic decree, nor ſuch, as, of its own nature, morally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges, and neceſſitates thoſe, who make uſe of it to ſin, and therefore cannot be reckon'd for ſuch a near and diſpoſing occaſion to ill, as the penitent ought, of neceſſity, to avoid, that he may be capable of receiving the Grace of Sacramental Abſolution.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me ſee, I pray you, ſayd <hi>Cleander, Bauni's</hi> text; which after he had read, he cry'd out, this, I am ſure, they may confidently call an other great impoſture, and ſufficiently circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciated, if I may be allow'd ſo to ſpeak; there is nothing wanting to make it ſo; it is very plain, and beyond all diſpute.</p>
                  <p>The caſe here ſpoke of, continued <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> relates to the ordinary, and common occaſions
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:174113:115"/>of Merchants, and dealers, whoſe way of traffic obliges them, <hi>To ſee, ſpeak, and treat with women, wives and maidens, whoſe looks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation make them often fall into ſin;</hi> and all this amounts, but to know, whether a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who cannot quit his trade, without the loſs of his reputation, and the injury of his family, having otherwiſe a firm reſolution to abſtain from ſin, <hi>dummodo firmiter proponat non peccare,</hi> may be allow'd to receive abſolution; or, whether the Confeſſor be oblig'd to refuſe it, or force him to renounce his trade. Is this to ſay, as <hi>Paſcal</hi> writes it in <hi>Italic</hi> letters, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently citing the page, that abſolution ought not to be refus'd to thoſe, who remain in the <hi>near occaſions of ſinning?</hi> where is the ſincerity! I have always heard it ſayd, that a near occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinning, is, that which never almoſt is reſiſted, as <hi>Bauni</hi> has juſt now told us, and as it is call'd by all other Divines, an <hi>occaſion that morally obliges to ſin.</hi> But althô there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual occaſions, wherein we are engag'd by ſome kind of employments, which make us often fall, this do's not hinder, but that theſe occaſions may be alſo often reſiſted; and there is a great deal of difference between the near occaſions and continual occaſions. What ſhall then become of this Merchant, if he do not turn Hermit or Carthuſian? for in moſt ſecular employments, men are oblig'd to treat with married and unmarried women, to talk with them, and to ſee 'um. If the Curat of Saint <hi>Euſtache's,</hi> ſhou'd obſerve this moral, there
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:174113:115"/>wou'd be yearly, at Eaſter, abundance of ſhops to be let in Saint <hi>Denis's</hi> ſtreet in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſeveral times diſcours'd, ſayd the Abbot, with Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> with Jeſuits, and Religious of other Orders, concerning the near occaſions of ſinning: about the difficulty one ought to make, of abſolving thoſe, who are in them, either willingly, or by neceſſity; and do you know, that abating the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, to which ſome Confeſſors do ſometimes carry this point, I have ſeldom met any more ſevere in this matter than the Jeſuits.</p>
                  <p>A Jeſuit, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> ſayd to me once, upon an occaſion like this we are diſcourſing of, that it was obſervable, that in the Cities, where they had Houſes, ſome people, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their callings, and condition of life; and known to have need of the gentleneſs and indulgence, which the Fathers of the Society are ſayd to ſhew to ſinners, were, ſeldom or ever, known to come to their Confeſſionals at Eaſter; an evident and manifeſt ſign, that they elſewhere met with better bargains, with more accommod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and complying Confeſſors, than the Jeſuits.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome, added <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who, believing that aſperſion, happen'd to be ſhrewdly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan'd; for the Knight of ....... one of your acquaintance, once, upon a time, aſſur'd me, that <hi>Paſcal's</hi> memoires were neither true nor certain; for, having rely'd upon them, he went to the Jeſuits once to Confeſſion; but that, in all his life, he had never been handled ſo rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that his abſolution was defer'd; and that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:174113:116"/>upon ſome conditions, which appear'd to him very hard to be obſerv'd. The Provincial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were, at that time, much in vogue; and the Knight was deceiv'd, and drawn in by them; who made no ſecret of this part of his caſe, which he was not aſham'd to diſcover: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the rage he was in, for being deluded, made him every where cry out, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> was in that, at leaſt, a meer impoſtor.</p>
                  <p>The Confeſſors, anſwer'd the Abbot, are much to be pitied; they are accus'd without being able to defend themſelves; and if ſome perſons, of the ſame character with your Knight, who do not think their reputation leſſon'd, by telling they were refus'd abſolution, did not, from time to time, vindicat the Jeſuits in this point, abundance of people, wou'd judge of them, juſt as an <hi>Oratorian</hi> whom I know by ſight and name, for a long time did. He was in the country with a Jeſuit of my acquaintance, who is not now of the Society. This Jeſuit had refus'd to give abſolution to a man in thoſe parts, who either brag'd, or complain'd of it; the <hi>Oratorian,</hi> much ſurpriz'd at the ſtory, ask'd the Jeſuit very ſeriouſly, whether any of their Order ever refus'd abſolution: it is commonly ſayd among us that none of you ever do. After ſuch little digreſſions as theſe, which were now and then made to refreſh themſelves, and prevent being tir'd, they went on with reading the Provincial Letters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This, Father, do's very much rejoyce me; there remains now no more, than to ſay a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:174113:116"/>man may, on ſet purpoſe, ſeek occaſions of ſinning; ſince it is lawful not to ſhun, or fly from them. Even that, alſo, is ſometimes permitted, added he; the famous Caſuiſt, <hi>Baſil Pontius,</hi> has ſayd it; Father <hi>Bauni</hi> quotes him, and approves his opinion, as you may ſee in his treatiſe of repentance <hi>q.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 94. <hi>A man may ſeek an occaſion directly and for it ſelf, (primò &amp; per ſe) when either his own, or his neighbour's ſpiritual, or temporal, good leads him to it.</hi> Truly, ſays I to him, I ſeem to be in a dream, when I find Religious men ſpea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> after this manner.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This turn of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that he ſeems to dream, when he hears Religious talk at this rate, do's ſuppoſe, without doubt, ſome very wicked thing in this deciſion. Not at all, anſwer'd the Abbot, it was only to make a more neat tranſition to the matter of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. See what a pleaſant thing follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Ha what! Father, tell me in conſcience, whether you your ſelf be of that opinion? no truly, ſayd the Father: do you then ſpeak, continued I, againſt your conſcience? not at all, ſayd he; I did not in this ſpeak according to my own conſcience, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Pontius,</hi> and Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> conſcience, and you may ſafely follow them, for they are two able men. What, Father, becauſe they have put theſe three lines in their books, is it lawful to ſeek for occaſions of ſinning? I did not believe, we were to take your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts for a rule, but only the Scripture and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:174113:117"/>the tradition of the Church. O good God! cry'd out the Father, you put me in mind of the Janſeniſts. Cannot Father <hi>Bauni</hi> and <hi>Baſil Pontius</hi> make an opinion probable? I am not ſatisfi'd, ſays I to him, with a probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: I deſire to have a ſure one. I ſee, plainly, ſayd the good Father to me, that you are ignorant of the doctrin of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; if you underſtood it, you wou'd ſpeak, after an other manner. Truly I muſt needs inſtruct you in this point; you ſhall not loſe your labor by coming hither: for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a right notion of this matter, you will not be able to underſtand any thing: it is the foundation, and the A. B. C. of all our Morals. I was raviſh'd to ſee him fall upon what I wiſh'd for.</q> Is not this pleaſantly brought in, continu'd the Abbot? and ought he not to have been guilty of a ſmall calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, rather than to have loſt ſo pretty a turn?</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak thus, not that I diſagree as to the truth of this quotation, on that I lay no ſtreſs: Father <hi>Pintereau</hi> and Father <hi>Cauſin</hi> in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to <hi>la Theologie Morale</hi> denied, that theſe words were in <hi>Bauni,</hi> having taken one of this Divine's aſſertions for an other; where <hi>Baſil Pontius</hi> is alſo quoted upon ſuch a kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which they believ'd was that, which the author of that book had attack'd. This miſtake made <hi>Paſcal</hi> triumph in his fifteenth letter. But he was well employ'd in the mean time; a little clearing and diſentangling of things will here diſcover a moſt evident calumny; which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:174113:117"/>conſiſts, in that the words of <hi>Pontius,</hi> cited by <hi>Bauni,</hi> do contain, with reference to the place from whence they are drawn, and according to the ſenſe there given them, no other, than a wiſe and moſt reaſonable doctrin; and yet <hi>Paſcal</hi> makes his readers take up ſuch a notion of the words, as that they might from them infer, a moſt deteſtable doctrin. Let us look upon them, as they ſtand in <hi>Pontius</hi> himſelf. Althô he be an <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> your Janſeniſt friend will in all appearance, upon <hi>Paſcal's</hi> quotation, and joyning him with <hi>Bauni,</hi> take him for a Jeſuit: for I ſee, he has plac'd him on the ſame ſhelf, and in the midſt of the Caſuiſts and Divines of the Society.</p>
                  <p>The words are to be found in the ſixth chapter of his addition to his book <hi>de Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio,</hi> where this Divine propoſes, whether a Catholic may in conſcience marry a heretic, who may be thereby endanger'd to be perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when there is otherwiſe a great deal of reaſon to make the match. <hi>An cum periculo perverſionis,</hi> ſayd he, in the title of the chapter, <hi>poſſit ex aliquâ magnâ cauſà contrahi matrimonium cum haereitco.</hi> The intereſt of the ſtate and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is concern'd in the marriage; there are hopes by it to draw the Catholics out of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; whom a heretic Prince, or Princeſs's Miniſters treat with the utmoſt ſeverity. Theſe are the examples propoſs'd by <hi>Baſil Pontius</hi> at the beginning of the chapter; and he anſwers, that, notwithſtanding, the Catholics danger of being perverted, the Marriage may be made
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:174113:118"/>with a good conſcience; provided the Catholic, confiding in the mercy of God, do's ſincerely reſolve, to continue faithful. <hi>Dum tamen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahat cum firmo propoſito non labendi, fidenſque de divina miſericordia &amp; gratia fore ut eripiatur ab eo periculo fine crimine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſupports his aſſertion by the example of <hi>Judith;</hi> who expos'd her ſelf to ſo dangerous occaſions, to ſave her Town of <hi>Bethulia.</hi> And alſo by the Marriage of <hi>Hesther,</hi> with <hi>Haſſuerus.</hi> By the authority of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and a number of other Doctors; <hi>Whence he thus concludes, concerning theſe and all other ſuch Caſes, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that all perſons do ſin in expoſing themſelves to danger, without ſome very preſſing cauſe or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity obliging them to it; but it may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, when ſuch an occaſion requires it: and it is not neceſſary that this cauſe ſhou'd be the ſpiritual good of the Soul, but it is ſufficient that it be a conſiderable, temporal, advantage, as is ſeen in</hi> Heſther's <hi>Marriage, and the conduct of</hi> Judith.</p>
                  <p>I deſire to know, continued the Abbot, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any thing extravagant in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; and what ground <hi>Paſcal</hi> had to ſay, <hi>I fancy my ſelf in a dream when I hear Religious men talk at this rate?</hi> and whether, on the contrary, he himſelf did not really dream, or rave, when he pretended to find in it ſuch great occaſions of ſcandal?</p>
                  <p>I'le make a farther remark, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who at that time was reading the paſſage in <hi>Bauni;</hi> and it is a ſecond circumſtance of the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:174113:118"/>calumny. <hi>Bauni</hi> do's not uſe <hi>Pontius's</hi> words, to prove a man may expoſe himſelf to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſinning, for a temporal advantage; but, only, by an argument call'd <hi>à fortiori,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his aſſertion, <hi>That one may ſometimes abſolve a perſon that is in a dangerous occaſion, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging him to quit it, when there is juſt cauſe not to do it, provided the perſon be truly penitent for his ſins paſt, and have a firm reſolution not to ſin any more. This occaſion,</hi> ſayd he, a little lower, <hi>ceaſing to be a near one, in the notion of Divines, from the moment it ceaſes to be voluntary: and it ceaſes to be voluntary, from the time, that with a ſtedfaſt reſolution not to offend God, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to continue in it.</hi> I am perfectly of your opinion, added <hi>Cleander,</hi> to the Abbot, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> had very great need of this tranſition, to ſet off, and make ſome ſport with his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But let us go on, and make an end.</p>
                  <p>The remaining part of the Letter we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining, ſayd the Abbot, relates to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of probability: but it is to no purpoſe to enter again into this matter, after all that has been already ſayd upon it; eſpecially ſince my deſign is, not to take notice of all <hi>Paſcals</hi> impoſtures. Nor will I ſay any thing of an opinion, he, in the ſame Letter, attributes to <hi>Reginaldus,</hi> and Father <hi>Cellot; That in Moral queſtions the new Caſuists are preferable to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers, althô theſe come nearer to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's times.</hi> This point has been already debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I am of opinion, that we ought not to imitate <hi>Paſcal</hi> in his repetitions.</p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:174113:119"/>
                  <p>Here they ſtop'd; <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Abbot, that they were extreamly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd at <hi>Paſcal's</hi> falſifications; and at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs of the memorials he made uſe of in writing the Provincial Letters: then they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed at what hour to meet again the next day, to examin the following Letters.</p>

                  <hi>greatneſs in the thoughts, and wit in the railleries, and that the art of Dialogue was here to be found whole and intire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were beginning to fall upon the ſecond Letter, juſt as the Abbot alighted. While we were waiting for you, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> to him, we were endevoring to take up a better opinion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:174113:119"/>of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> and an other impreſſion than what you yeſterday left of him in our minds. We alſo endevor'd to leſſen the horror of that frightful idea you gave us of him when you ſo often convinc'd him of calumny and impoſture.</p>
               <p>How cou'd you go about it, ſayd the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, for the proofs I brought, are perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable; and a man, that has but eyes and underſtands how to read, cannot but be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd of their force and their ſolidity.</p>
               <p>We made no reflexion upon that, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> we only examin'd, what right he had to the qualities of an extraordinary wit and an excellent writer.</p>
               <p>Thoſe are the qualities for which he is to be moſt valued, replied the Abbot, and not at all incompatible with what I ſayd of him yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. <hi>Paſcal</hi> is a man of wit, a good writer, and very perfect in the art of ſlandering: he is pleaſant, bold, expert, and happy in the trade of lying. The bare reading of the Provincial Letters diſcovers the two firſt qualities, and the obſervations we have made upon them do palpably demonſtrate all the reſt.</p>
               <p>You are then, it ſeems, convinc'd, ſayd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> that theſe Letters, whatever otherwiſe they may be, are at leaſt a Maſter-piece of wit, and in this kind one of the wonders of the world.</p>
               <p>Ho, not ſo, anſwer'd the Abbot, to ſay that it is a pleaſant piece, and wherein there is a great deal of wit, and art, is, what one in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is bound to ſay: but to ſay, that it is a Maſter-piece, and without faults, a great many
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:174113:120"/>faults, a man muſt be very much <hi>Paſcal's</hi> friend, or perſwaded by his friends to a mighty degree of obſtinacy. I am of opinion, that he writes eaſily, naturally, and with life, but he neither writes purely, nor exactly, and Mr. <hi>Perrault,</hi> in ſaying there was nothing but <hi>purity in the language,</hi> did not ſpeak like an able, or at leaſt like a ſincere Acadamiſt.</p>
               <p>How you decide the matter! Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> laughing, we durſt hardly ſay ſo much, after we had ran over, and ſeriouſly examin'd the firſt Letter.</p>
               <p>If I ſhou'd ſhew you, anſwer'd the Abbot, the copy I have at home, you cou'd hardly find one page without ſome ſtrokes of a pencil, pointing out faults againſt the purity of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or the elegance of ſtile, or the art of Dialogue, and very often, alſo, marking out, a poor, mean thought, or a pitiful conceit.</p>
               <p>Are there as many, proportionably, in that, as in this? ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> ſhewing him the firſt Letter, which they had newly examin'd, and ſcored in abundance of places. Very near as many, anſwer'd the Abbot. <hi>Cleander,</hi> turning over the book interrupted them, and ſayd, I have here met a paſſage, which really ſhews, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> underſtood the rules of Dialogue: but it alſo ſhews, that he did not always think of them time enuff. It is, at the beginning of the ſixth Letter. <q>I will do it, ſayd he, (meaning the repetition of the diſcourſe he had with his Jeſuit) and I will do it more exactly, than I did the other. For I have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:174113:120"/>now brought my table-book, to mark down the quotations of the paſſages, and I am very ſorry I did not bring it with me the firſt time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This precaution, and this little word, thrown in by the by is, indeed, neceſſary, to make the matter have ſome ſeeming truth in it; a main eſſential thing in all Dialogues. For it is not probable, he cou'd remember, exactly, all the places the Jeſuit had cited out of the Caſuiſts, and yet he had reaſon to mark them, ſince he was to give an account of the Converſation to his friend in the Country.</p>
               <p>But that which is very pleaſant, and made me ſay, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> do's not remember the rules of Dialogue time enuff, is, that in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Letter, where he relates a former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he had had with the Jeſuit, where at he ſayd he had no <hi>table-book,</hi> there are yet full as many paſſages quoted; the books, the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the very pages therein are ſet down, at leaſt, as exactly as in this. Not to ſpeak of that liſt of near fifty Caſuiſts, Divines and Canoniſts, whoſe names ſeem to him ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be pronounc'd, that he ask'd his Jeſuit, whether all of them were Chriſtians, and yet, notwithſtanding, he made a ſhift, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>table-book,</hi> to remember them all, very exactly.</p>
               <p>This is a very good remark, anſwer'd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus;</hi> but in all appearance, this precaution, being taken up after the thing was over, muſt have been the effect of the obſervation of ſome one of <hi>Paſcal's</hi> friends, who diſcover'd this fault
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:174113:121"/>of his a little too late. This, perhaps, was the reaſon, added the Abbot, laughing, that we have found in his fourth and fifth Letters ſo many falſe citations, and ſo many mangled paſſages out of <hi>Laiman, Bauni,</hi> and <hi>Filiucius.</hi> If <hi>Paſcal</hi> had had his table-book then, he might have been more exact; but it is manifeſt, that in writing his diſcourſe, he ſpoke by heart. As to the reſt, added the Abbot, if the then critics of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> did oblige <hi>Paſcal</hi> to make mention here of his table-book, that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letters might appear more true, and free from the faults he committed in the two former, they afterwards alter'd their opinions; for in the latter editions, they have omitted this precaution of the <hi>table-book,</hi> which by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the fault you ſpeak, of had made it more appear.</p>
               <p>It is true, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> reading this place in the edition <hi>in twelves,</hi> which he had in his hands, that this article is left out; but now we are upon this ſubject, continu'd he, I find that <hi>Paſcal</hi> had not yet ſufficiently reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rules of Dialogue, when he ſuppos'd his Letters were become public, and, in his eighth, writ to his friend in the Country, that every one in <hi>Paris</hi> was gueſſing at the author; ſome ſaying it was a Doctor of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> others, fathering them upon four or five perſons, who, like himſelf, were neither Prieſts, nor Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. This alone, takes away all appearance of truth, from the converſations related in the eighth, ninth, and tenth Letters. For to be
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:174113:121"/>able to continue theſe diſcourſes with his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt, it muſt be ſuppos'd, the Jeſuits were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the former Letters ran about, and were ſpread all over <hi>Paris;</hi> and did not know, that all the world were delighted with them; that their myſteries were diſcover'd, and all honeſt men enrag'd at them. Now, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this ignorance of the Jeſuits in a point that touch'd them ſo near, ſeems too groſs to carry any likelihood of truth with it. <hi>Paſcal</hi> was very much out here, and did not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reflect upon the matter.</p>
               <p>There is yet, anſwer'd the Abbot, an other more conſiderable fault, which runs thrô all <hi>Paſcals</hi> Dialogues, and it is, that he overſtrains and carryes too far the character of his chief Actor. The firſt and great Perſonage of his Dialogues, is a Jeſuit, a well meaning good man and without trics; who franckly tells all he deſires to fiſh out of him. This is not much amiſs, and <hi>Paſcal</hi> has, by this contrivance, a fair game on't. But of this plain ſimple Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, which at firſt he made him ſeem to be, he has inſenſibly made a natural, a ſot, and ſilly to the higheſt degree. He laughs at him, and mock's him to his face; he openly rallyes him without his perceiving it; he fooliſhly runs into ſnares, that any one might plainly ſee were laid to catch him; he makes him ſpeak the greateſt impertinences imaginable; and all this he makes him do, in the name, or as the mouth, of the whole Society; and takes all he ſays for granted; believes his quotations
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:174113:122"/>true; the ſenſe he gives them; the principles he lay's down; and the application he makes of the whole.</p>
               <p>I know there were Critics at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> who alſo found this fault with the main point of his Comedies. But it was anſwer'd, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it was to be paſs'd over, and the ſame method to be ſtill continu'd; that the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Letters with this fault, had all the effect that cou'd be expected from them; that the nicety was unſeaſonable; that very few wou'd take notice of it; and that when once the greateſt part of the world was got into a vein of laughing at any thing, or upon any ſubject, the moſt exact and obſerving muſt, whether they will or no, carry on the ſame humor.</p>
               <p>However it was reſolv'd, that before the following editions, there ſhou'd be an advertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the reader, wherein this Perſon's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was to be juſtifi'd, as much as poſſible; in the ſame manner, almoſt, as <hi>Molicre</hi> had apologiz'd for his Man-hater in his preface to his Comedy, <hi>le Miſanthrope.</hi> 
                  <q>This Father, we are told in the advice to the Reader, is a good man, as there are many ſuch among them, who wou'd have hated the wickedneſs and malice of his Society had he been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it ...... he that heard him was neither willing to ſhock him, nor to conſent to his doctrin; but receiv'd it with a double meaning raillery; which might have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcover'd his ſenſe to any perſon leſs prejudic'd than this Caſuiſt.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:174113:122"/>
               <p>Double meaning raillery, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus!</hi> witneſs what <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays in his fifth Letter, after the paſſage out of <hi>Bauni,</hi> concerning the ſeeking for occaſions. <hi>Truly, ſays I to him, I ſeem to be in a dream, when I find Religious men ſpeak in this manner.</hi> What double meaning raillery is this? of all <hi>Paſcal's</hi> railleries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd he, there are not three, that can be call'd by that name. The writer of this advice to the Reader calls this Jeſuit <hi>a good man,</hi> he ought, without doubt if he wou'd have ſpoken properly to have call'd him an Ideot. Such a man cou'd never have had in the Society, the quality <hi>Paſcal</hi> gives him of a Caſuiſt. And what this man ſays is ſo falſe, that among the Jeſuits there are many like him, that there cou'd hardly be found two like him, among all the moſt ſolitary hermits in the world; and I do verily believe, that one muſt go to Bedlam, to meet with ſuch an other example of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> one needs go but to the <hi>Jacobins:</hi> the <hi>Dominican</hi> in the ſecond Letter, is, altogether, as ſilly as the Jeſuit is in the others. Theſe two perſonages are both caſt in the ſame mould: but I think it wou'd have done well to have made ſome little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between their characters. I no ſooner meet the Jeſuit in the fourth Letter, than the <hi>Jacobin</hi> comes into my mind. But to ſpeak freely, <hi>Paſcal's</hi> having made the one to reſemble the other ſo exactly, is no ſign that his wit or fancy was over fertil or luxuriant.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:174113:123"/>
               <p>As I was lately reading with one of my friends, added the Abbot, <hi>Horace de Arte Poëtica,</hi> we paus'd a while, to conſider one of the moſt eſſential precepts, given by this Poët of the art of Dialogue, extreamly ill obſerv'd in <hi>Paſcal's</hi> Letters, and compriz'd in theſe three verſes. <q>

                     </l>
                  </q> And 'tis what is daily ſayd, that when a man has once given a character to a new perſonage, brought upon the Stage, he muſt take care to carry it on exactly, every where to the end of the Scene or Play.</p>
               <p>The figure, or character he has given the Jeſuits in his Letters, is moſt certainly new, and altogether peculiar to <hi>Paſcal.</hi> In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scene, he gives them, ſucceſsfully enuff, the character of wit, policy, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, of men who underſtand how to inſinuat themſelves into the Courts of Princes, to get into the confidence of great men, to win the people's affections, and make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their Conſciences, by certain arts that for a long time had been kept ſecret. But after he had improv'd as much as he was able, to their diſadvantage, the myſtery of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the better to back and ſupport this notion and idea, and to confirm his readers in it, he proceeds to the direction of intention; which in his way of explaining is very ridiculous; he makes the Jeſuits ſpeak of it, in ſo pitiful a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:174113:123"/>manner, ſay ſo many poor things, and advance ſo many extravagances, and ſo groſs and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd impieties, that the firſt thought of a reader, who reflected never ſo little, muſt be to ask where is all this pretended policy and cunning of the Jeſuits?</p>
               <p>What? did the Jeſuits deſign to eſtabliſh themſelves in all parts of the earth, to make themſelves Maſters of the people's conſciences, to govern in the Courts of Princes, to get into the confidence of Prelats, and Magiſtrates, and all this by authorizing robberies, violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, murders, duels, ſimonie and the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of inferiors towards their ſuperiors? in one word, by all thoſe things, which give men the moſt horrid apprehenſions, and moſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of diſturbing the peace of the public, of giving Princes the greateſt diſquiets, and of ſcandaliſing the moſt honeſt men. And which is more by printing and publiſhing all this, in <hi>France, Spain, Germany, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Paſcal</hi> is pleas'd to ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>But do you remember, added the Abbot, what he ſays in his thirteenth and fourteenth Letters? for it is in thoſe, chiefly, he takes upon him to preach againſt and run down the Jeſuits. There after he had cul'd ſome lines out of the texts of ſeveral of their authors, which in his ſeventh Letter he had attack'd, and which the Jeſuits had defended, and which in theſe two Letters he had again ſtich'd and put together, with all poſſible art and malice, he addreſſes himſelf to the Jeſuits, as if they

What think you? do theſe things hang well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? and is this his character all of a piece?</p>
               <p>This obſervation, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> ſeems very well carry'd on; and opens a way for judging of ſome particular paſſages in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters, after a very different manner from the judgment the world has hitherto paſs'd upon them. But, if you pleaſe, we will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue our deſign, and begin with the examination of the ſixth Letter. That was my own inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſayd the Abbot, and therefore I am well pleas'd with your propoſition.</p>

                  <head>The following part of the ſixth Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CLeander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> to make the more haſt, had, the day before, agreed to compare <hi>Paſcal's</hi> quotations, one by one, with the Jeſuits books, and divided between themſelves the ſeveral paſſages. They had alſo mark'd in the authors, the matters in queſtion, ſo that now they had no more left to do, but to open their books, and communicate their reſpective reflexions to each other.</p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:174113:125"/>
                  <p>The firſt article in this Letter, is part of my province, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus. Paſcal,</hi> accuſes there the Jeſuits, of interpreting the Popes Bulls in favor of ſinners, and in particular, that, by which <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIV has declar'd murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unworthy of the ſanctuary and protection of Churches, and that they ought to be drawn out thence by force, and put into the hands of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Before we go any farther, ſayd the Abbot, interrupting him, what think you of theſe Gentlemen? do they not do very handſomly to reproch the Jeſuits with the interpretation of a Bull? they who had the impudence and the raſhneſs, to laugh at, and make ſport with, the decree, or Conſtitution, made by one Pope in matters of faith, confirm'd by an other Pope, and receiv'd by all Chriſtians, they, whoſe chief Hero fully inform'd of the cenſures of two Popes, and of the moſt eminent Prelats of the Kingdom, againſt the <hi>Mons</hi> Teſtament, had yet the confidence to ſay and Print, that they cou'd not meddle with, or fall upon this book <hi>without being guilty of folly and impertinence?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nov. def. to 2. pa. 563.</note> Let them freely ſubmit to, and ſign the decrees of <hi>Innocent</hi> the X. and <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII, againſt <hi>Janſenius's</hi> propoſitions, without an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a comment, and then the Jeſuits will defend themſelves about the interpretation, whereof they are accus'd: till then, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Janſeniſts in this point ought not to be receiv'd againſt Jeſuits.</p>
                  <p>This wou'd be a puzzling inſtance, ſayd

                     <hi>Cleander,</hi> to a Janſeniſt: but you know very well, that I am not one: but after all, the Janſeniſt may be in the wrong, and yet the Jeſuit not in the right. Let us ſee then, ſayd he to <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> whether you can bring off <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> from this buſineſs an other way.</p>
                  <p>I have taken ſome pains about the matter, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and I have alſo known by experience, on this occaſion, how uſeful Mr. Abbot's help has prov'd to us in our examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Provincial Letters. I read at firſt the beginning of the ſixth Letter, to which I pray you liſten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Sir I told you at the end of my laſt letter, that this good Father, the Jeſuit, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to make me underſtand, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Caſuiſts do reconcile the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are between their opinions and the Popes deciſions, the Councels and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. At my ſecond viſit, he did, really, inſtruct me in the matter; and I'le repeat to you what paſs'd between us. One of the ways we have, ſayd the good Father, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe contradictions, is, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of ſome terms. For example, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIV has declar'd, that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins or Murderes ought not to enjoy the benefit of Sanctuary in Churches, but to be drawn out thence. However our four and twenty old men ſay, <hi>tr. 6. ex.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 27. <hi>That thoſe who kill men, treacherouſly, ought not to incur the penalties of this Bull.</hi> This ſeems to you, to be contrary to the Popes decree; but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:174113:126"/>they reconcile it by interpreting the word <hi>Aſſaſſin</hi> as they do by theſe words. <hi>Are not Murderers unworthy to enjoy the privilege of Churches? Yes by the Bull of</hi> Gregory XIV, <hi>but we underſtand by the word</hi> ASSASSIN, <hi>thoſe who have taken mony to kill a man treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly. Whence it comes to paſs, that thoſe, who Murder, without receiving any reward, but only to oblige their friends, are not call'd</hi> ASSASSINS.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt thing I did, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> was to conſult the text of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> to ſee whether it were faithfully reported; and I was ſurpriz'd, to find the aſſertion, directly contrary to what was cited. <hi>he that treacherouſly kills a man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſword or poiſon, is excluded from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the Church's Sanctuary. Proditoriè ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem occidens, ſeu ferro, ſeu veneno, caretne Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae immunitate? Caret.</hi> Now you ſee another plain falſification to encreaſe <hi>Paſcal's</hi> liſt. But, reading on <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> text, I found the bad opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I conceiv'd of the accuſer, did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, my taking up, from the following words, a diſadvantagious ſuſpicion of the perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd. <hi>A man is ſayd to kill treacherouſly, when he kills one who did no way diſtruſt him; for which reaſon he who kills his enemy is not call'd a traitor, althô he had layn in wait for him, and ſtruck, stab'd, or ſhot him behind.</hi> This, at firſt, ſeem'd to me, to have all the air and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a <hi>diſtinction</hi> and the ſubtility of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt. I read on: <hi>Have the Aſſaſſins or Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a right to the privilege of the Church's Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary? No, according to the decree of</hi> Gregory XIV.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:174113:127"/>
                     <hi>I underſtand by the word</hi> ASSASSIN, <hi>a man who has taken mony, on ſet purpoſe, to ly in wait, ſurprize and kill an other; who is not upon his guard, nor diſtruſtful of him For which reaſon, he, who, without receiving any mony, kills a man only to pleaſure his friend, is not call'd an</hi> ASSAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIN. <hi>As to the reſt, all thoſe, who are acceſſory to the murder, who favor, or give the Murderer ſuccor, or carry him off, are depriv'd of the right of Sanctuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt part of this deciſion, continu'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> appears as looſe, as the laſt ſeems ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; and I cou'd not tell what to think on't. As to the matter of Bulls, I have heard it ſayd, in general, that they are written in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtile and language, which a man muſt underſtand well to judge of them aright. This made me ſuſpend my judgment upon this point; but I went immediatly to conſult a neighbor and a friend of mine, who is a very able Canoniſt, and ask'd him his thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this deciſion of <hi>Eſcobar.</hi> After he had read it quite thrô, he told me, no body cou'd ſpeak more juſtly, or more learnedly than this Jeſuit had done. In all appearance, ſayd he, you are moſt ſcandalis'd at the definitions he gives of the words <hi>Aſſaſſin</hi> and <hi>Treachery,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions he adds to them: but your ſurpriſe will he over, as ſoon as you have heard the hiſtory of this Bull.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know then, continu'd he, that the immunities and privileges of Churches, have always been, and, ſtill, are, to this day,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:174113:127"/>look'd upon in <hi>Italy,</hi> as a point of the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; which the Popes, on all occaſions, have extreamly recommended to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Magiſtrates, and which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them zealouſly to maintain, againſt the attempts of ſecular Magiſtrates; but yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, abuſes having crept in, and this privilege, having been the occaſion of many horrid crimes, ſome Popes, particularly, <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV and <hi>Pius</hi> V, thought fit to reſtrain them, and by their Bulls made on this account per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that certain criminals might be drawn out of the Churches, and deliver'd into the hands of ſecular juſtice, without regard to any immunities whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the ſecular Magiſtrates extended theſe Bulls farther than the Popes intended; which oblig'd <hi>Gregory</hi> XIV to make a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, for the more exact regulation of theſe things, and for the taking away all difficulties, contentions, and diſputes; wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, more particularly, the criminals and the crimes, that were to be excepted from privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, together with the manner of proceeding on ſuch occaſions. Thoſe, who kill men trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly, and Aſſaſſins and Murderers are in the number of criminals excepted; <hi>Qui prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriè proximum ſuum occiderint, aut Aſſaſſinij.</hi> But in the end, he forbids, that any other crimes, or criminals, except ſuch as are expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Bull, ſhou'd be excluded from the ſanctuary and privilege of Churches.</p>
                  <p>You muſt likewiſe know, ſayd he to me,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:174113:128"/>that, in the explication of theſe kind of Bulls, men take care to ſpeak with all the exactneſs and rigor of law, and as much, as poſſible, not to give the terms any other ſignification than what is receiv'd and authoris'd by the ſtile and uſage of lawyers. Now in the law, <hi>proditoriè occidere,</hi> and the word <hi>Aſſaſſinius</hi> have no larger a ſignification than that, which <hi>Eſcobar</hi> here gives them; whereupon my Canoniſt made me read <hi>Calvin's Lexicon juris, Bartholus, Ambroſius, Farinacius, Covarruvios,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. He moreover added, that if <hi>Eſcobar</hi> had ſpoken otherwiſe, he had not follow'd the doctrin of lawyers, nor the terms, nor intention of the Bull, and, contrary to the prohibition, wou'd have reſtrain'd, more than he ought to have done, a privilege, of which the holy See is very jealous. But perceiving I had brought with me <hi>Eſcobar</hi> and the Provincial Letters, he gueſs'd the occaſion of my doubt, and ſayd to me, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> was in the wrong for attacking <hi>Eſcobar</hi> upon this point; and if he had not a little falſifi'd the matter, he had in it betray'd, at leaſt, his own ignorance. I anſwer'd, that I wou'd freely pardon his ignorance, provided it were invincible, but for that I wou'd not ſwear.</p>
                  <p>Your Canoniſt, ſayd the Abbot, might have alſo added, that <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> in ſpeaking ſo, had but follow'd the uſage of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> where this Bull is obſerv'd after the manner wherein he has explain'd it. You may ſee then, concluded <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that here is another point diſpatch'd to the honor of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> who
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:174113:128"/>had waded too far into a matter he did not underſtand.</p>
                  <p>That's true, anſwer'd the Abbot, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opinion you take up of the imprudence, or ignorance of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> do not forget his falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of this paſſage: which you your ſelf acknowledg'd in the beginning, where you ſaw he made <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſpeak the direct contrary to what he had ſayd. We ſhall be ſure to keep an account of all, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you imagin, ſayd <hi>Cleander</hi> to <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that it has coſt me leſs pains, than it has done you, to inform my ſelf fully in the charge <hi>Paſcal</hi> has drawn up againſt the Jeſuit <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> touching Alms? you muſt know then, that I read over laſt night at full length, this Divines treatiſe upon this ſubject; which took up my time till midnight: but I do not at all repent the pains I have taken. For it is hard to meet, upon that ſubject, a work more inſtructive and more judicious, or where more is decided by the authority of Scripture, Fathers and Canons. And as for the fourth chapter, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has found fault with, I wiſh that all our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd Prieſts and Abbots, who thunder againſt, and run down in words, the looſe Morals, wou'd read it with attention, and practiſe it exactly: I ſhou'd then willingly refer my ſelf to their opinion.</p>
                  <p>What you ſay do's very much ſurpriſe me, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus:</hi> for mind I pray what our <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays upon the point. <q>In the ſame manner, it is ſayd in the Goſpel, <hi>Give Alms
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:174113:129"/>of your ſuperfluities, or of what you have to ſpare,</hi> and yet, notwithſtanding, many Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts have found out ways, to free the richeſt perſons from the obligation of giving alms; this alſo may ſeem, to you, contrary to the rules of the Goſpel; but it is eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd, by interpreting the word <hi>ſuperfluities,</hi> or <hi>to ſpare,</hi> in ſuch a way, as that no body ſhall have more than enuff; and this the learned <hi>Vaſquez</hi> has done in his treatiſe of alms <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>What worldly men hoard up to raiſe and better their own and their relations ſtate and condition, is not call'd ſuperfluous: for which reaſon you will hardly find, that any of theſe people who live in the world, have more than enuff, no not even Kings themſelves.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> has <hi>Paſcal</hi> falſifi'd this paſſage alſo of <hi>Vaſquez?</hi> yes, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> this paſſage alſo is falſifi'd; and it is only by vertue of this falſification, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> concludes from <hi>Vaſquez's</hi> doctrin, <hi>That the Caſuiſts have found out means to free the richeſt people from the obligation of giving alms.</hi> This concluſion do's not at all follow from this Divine's doctrin; but it is directly contrary to it; the reading the whole paſſage, of which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has quoted but one part, will, without more ado, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of this truth.</p>
                  <p>The falſification conſiſts in this, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſay, in general, <hi>That one cou'd hardly ever find any thing ſuperfluous among ſecular or worldly people.</hi> Whereas <hi>Vaſquez</hi> had only ſayd, <hi>That it cou'd hardly be found, that worldly
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:174113:129"/>men had any thing ſuperfluous, with reference to their ſtate and condition.</hi> Take notice of theſe laſt words <hi>to their ſtate,</hi> which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd and left out, you'll quickly ſee of what importance they are. <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> in the place quoted, comparing the obligation of benefic'd perſons, with that of pure laies in giving of alms, ſpeaks after this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Firſt I hold, that Eccleſiaſtics, as well as Seculars, are oblig'd to ſuccor and relieve their neighbors, in their <hi>extream</hi> neceſſities; as for other great neceſſities <hi>graves neceſſitates,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtics are oblig'd to eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, at leaſt, out of what is ſuperfluous to <hi>their condition,</hi> and ſometimes out of what is neceſſary to it, as I have already ſayd even of Secular men's obligation; <hi>Graves etiam ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitates ſtatûs proximorum &amp; alias graves tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Eccleſiaſtici ſublevare, ut minimùm de ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluo ſtatûs &amp; aliquando de neceſſario, ut ſupra de ſaecularibus diximus.</hi> But, continu'd <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> there is a very great and notable difference, between Seculars and Eccleſiaſties. For firſt, laics are not oblig'd to go and ſeek out the poor, but only to give alms to thoſe they meet; whereas Eccleſiaſtics, and chiefly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as <hi>Corduba</hi> has very well obſerv'd, are oblig'd to go and ſeek them; becauſe they are the Fathers of the poor, and the care of them do's particularly belong to them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe lay-men have a right, to treaſure up part of their patrimony, to alter or better their own, or their relations cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:174113:130"/>and condition. And what is thus reſerv'd is not call'd ſuperfluous in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. <hi>Et tunc illud non dicitur ſuperfluum.</hi> Whence it comes to paſs, that upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it can hardly be ſayd, that lay-men, even Kings, have any thing ſuperfluous to <hi>their condition. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde vix in ſaecularibus invenies etiam in Regibus, ſuperfluum ſtatui.</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops, nor other Eccleſiaſtics, can make uſe of their benefices, to enlarge their fortune, or raiſe themſelves, or their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to any higher degree. Becauſe, that out of the revenues of the Church they have only a right to an honeſt livelihood for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and therefore hardly any, that have good livings, but either have, or may have, what is ſuperfluous to their <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if they live modeſtly and manage well.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pray read no more, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him; the falſification you have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is, not only, an undoubted matter of fact, but it is yet alſo true, that this paſſage alone, is ſufficient to ſhew, the vanity and the falſhood of all <hi>Paſcal's</hi> reaſonings. For not only Eccleſiaſtics, and benefic'd perſons, are here treated, as ſeverely, as they cou'd wiſh, and much more roughly than many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but we likewiſe ſee, he obliges the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars alſo, to relieve their neighbors, as well in their extream, as in their other, great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, neceſſities, <hi>At the expenſe of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous part of their fortune, and even of that which is neceſſary to their state and condition of life. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t

                        <hi>That as to a man's ſalvation it wou'd be as ſafe, according to</hi> Vaſquez, <hi>not to give alms, provided he have but ambition enuff to hinder him from having any thing ſuperfluous, as it is ſafe, according to the Goſpel, to have no ambition, that you may have wherewithal to give alms and relieve the poor?</hi>
                     </q> This concluſion appears now to me as falſe, as the expreſſion always ſeem'd obſcure, ill turn'd and very much wreſted.</p>
                  <p>I do not intend, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> laughing, thus to loſe the pains I have taken in ſtudying the doctrin of <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> Have the patience, I pray you, to hear the ſubſtance of it.
<note place="margin">Cap. 1. dub. 3. n. 19.</note> I'le give it you in few words, and it will not be unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the defenſe of this Doctor. After he had demonſtrated out of the Scripture, and the Fathers, the indiſpenſable obligation the rich lay under, of giving alms, he demands upon what this obligation is founded, and ſets down the ſeveral opinions of Divines, upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, among the reſt, that of Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who ſays there are two grounds, or reaſons of this obligation. The firſt, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſity of our neighbor, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the ſuperfluous wealth of the rich; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that by the right of nature, the goods of fortune, being equal and common to all, and their appropriation to particulars being made but by the law of nations, he that has
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:174113:131"/>any ſuperfluity, or remainder, above his uſe and condition, is not the real Maſter of that remainder, but only a Steward, to diſtribute it among thoſe who are in need.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaſquez</hi> do's not account theſe two reaſons of <hi>Cajetan</hi> to be ſolid enuff, for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the precept of giving alms; and, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, refutes that which he takes, from the obligation of giving what is ſuperfluous, by vertue of the law of nations.
<note place="margin">Num. 24.</note> For ſayd he, to ſpeak preciſely, if to have any remainder of wealth, over and above a man's uſe, founded a reaſon and obligation, a man wou'd be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to part with it, althô there ſhou'd be no poor to receive it, which wou'd be abſurd. Whence he concludes, that the obligation of giving alms, is not founded, properly, upon men's ſuperfluities, but upon charity; which requires me not to refuſe my ſuperfluities to my neighbor, when under a neceſſity. And I am of opinion, that this is both very well and truly ſayd.</p>
                  <p>Beſides,
<note place="margin">Num. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Vaſquez</hi> makes ſeveral kind of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; the word ſuperfluity, having in it many relations, or meanings; that which is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to one thing, may be neceſſary to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what, in the language of Divines, is ſuperfluous to nature, is not always ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in reference to decency, and the the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that ſtate of life, wherein God's Providence has plac'd us.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, upon occaſion of the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of obligation all men are under of giving
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:174113:131"/>alms out of their ſuperfluities, <hi>Vaſquez</hi> explains two ways, wherein wealth may be ſayd to be ſuperfluous to the poſſeſſor's ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſays it may be ſayd to be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, either with reference to the ſtate he is actually in, or with reference to a higher ſtate, ſuppoſing he may have a right to raiſe himſelf to that ſtate, and may do it without ſin. <hi>Quem ego licitè poſſum acquirere:</hi> So that the ſame thing may be ſayd to be, and not to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in different reſpects. It will be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to my preſent ſtate, if it be not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly neceſſary to the conſervation of my being. But it will not be ſuperfluous, with reference to the ſtate I may lawfully acquire, if I cannot otherwiſe raiſe my ſelf to it. Whereupon <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> puts a caſe of conſcience, to wit, whether a man, ſeeing his neighbor ready to fall from the condition he is in, be oblig'd, under pain of mortal ſin, to maintain him in it, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the mony, wherewith he deſign'd to raiſe himſelf to a ſtation he might lawfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to. And he anſwers that he is not oblig'd.</p>
                  <p>That is to ſay, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that if I am a Counſellor of Parlament, and ſee one of my Brethren forc'd to quit his place, becauſe he is unable to ſupport the expenſe, I am not oblig'd to give him the mony, with which I intended to purchaſe a Maſter of Requeſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to which I might lawfully aſpire.</p>
                  <p>This inſtance, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> explains the thing perfectly well. And thence <hi>Vaſquez</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that, even, according to the principles
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:174113:132"/>of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who agrees with him in the notion and diſtinction of ſuperfluity, a man will be under none, or ſmall obligation, to relieve his neighbor, ſuppoſing this obligation be taken preciſely to depend upon what he has of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity. This is only a conſequence <hi>ad hominem,</hi> to ſpeak in the language of the Schools, to demonſtrate to <hi>Cajetan,</hi> that the reaſon, upon which he founds the obligation of giving alms, is not a true reaſon. His argument is indeed both ſtrong and good, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Liſten now, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions he draws from the principle he lays down, that the obligation of giving alms is preciſely founded upon charity, whereby you will ſee, whether this Divine be over looſe in the matter. This, in his opinion, is the order charity preſcribes for ſuccoring our neighbor. <q>You are not oblig'd to relieve your Brother,
<note place="margin">Cap. 1. num. 25.26.</note> at an equal loſs to your ſelf with what he wou'd have undergone for want of your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor. But you are oblig'd to aſſiſt him, at the expenſe of any leſs part of your own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than that which he is like to loſe. So that, ſays he, I am not bound to ſave my neighbors life, at the loſs of my own; but I am bound to ſave it, at the expenſe of all my fortune; and in all other caſes the rule is proportionably the ſame. Otherwiſe, <hi>How can the love of God dwell in me,</hi> if in ſuch a neceſſity, I eſteem my honor and my wealth more, than the life of my neighbor?</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>This being ſuppos'd, continues he, if my
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:174113:132"/>neighbor be in danger of death (which is commonly call'd extream neceſſity) or if he be juſt falling into a great fit of ſickneſs, I am oblig'd to relieve him, with all that is ſuperfluous to the entertainment and ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my ſelf, and thoſe who depend upon me ...... If I do not expoſe all my fortune, to prevent my neighbors falling into this evil, I do not keep and follow the rules and order of charity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to obſerve this very order, if my neighbor runs the risk of loſing his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this being a thing more pretious than gold, or any office, or employment to be bought with gold, I am oblig'd to ſecure him from this evil, thô I ſhou'd thereby fall from my preſent ſtate and condition, and which is yet more, althô my family ſhou'd ſuffer by it, yet ought I, in this caſe alſo, to ſuccor him with all my poſſeſſions, beyond what is juſt neceſſary to ſupport nature.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if this man, by ſome loſs, be upon the point of having his fortune ruin'd, I am oblig'd to help him with all that is ſuperfluous to my own ſtate, but not with what is neceſſary to maintain it. Becauſe I am not oblig'd to ſuccor him at an equal dammage to what I wou'd hinder.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>It is not enuff, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> to ſay, that this Moral is not looſe or large; I am very certain abundance of people wou'd find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſtrict and ſevere, and, in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, perhaps, a little too extravagant.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:174113:133"/>
                  <p>Let us return to the falſification, continu'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> and oblige <hi>Paſcal</hi> to argue in form by the principle he borrows, or pretends to borrow from <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> This then is <hi>Paſcals</hi> argument.</p>
                  <p>A man is not oblig'd to give alms but out of his ſuperfluities. But the rich will hardly be found according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> to have any ſuperfluities, therefore the rich, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> are never, almoſt, oblig'd to give alms.</p>
                  <p>I'le allow the firſt propoſition to be true,
<note place="margin">Letter 12</note> but the ſecond is not <hi>Vaſquez's.</hi> He did not ſay the rich had ſeldom any ſuperfluities, and therefore the conſequence <hi>Paſcal</hi> draws from thence, do's no way concern this Jeſuit. This is clear, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus.</hi> Let us now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> make a formal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Vaſquez's</hi> propoſition, as it really ſtands without any falſification, and ſee whether <hi>Paſcal</hi> will find his account in it.</p>
                  <p>One may ſay, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> that the rich have rarely any thing ſuperfluous to their ſtate and condition, but the rich are not oblig'd to give alms, but out of what is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, therefore, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> the rich are oblig'd rarely to give alms.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuits will here ſay, that the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the ſenſe <hi>Vaſquez</hi> gives it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſtinction he has made, of the ſtate a man is in, and the ſtate he may lawfully aſpire to, is very underſtandable, reaſonable, and true. The ſecond propoſition, is falſe, both according to him and all Divines. For
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:174113:133"/>he, as they do, holds that the rich are oblig'd, on many occaſions, to give alms, even out of what is neceſſary to their ſtate. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by looking on his doctrin, concerning the order, preſcrib'd by charity, and it is what we have juſt now read.</p>
                  <p>It is then true, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> making an end, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> has falſifi'd this paſſage; and that the inferences he makes contrary to the precept of alms, cannot, without falſifying it, be drawn from <hi>Vaſquez's</hi> principle. Whence it ſeems clear to me, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and that in this point, <hi>Paſcal</hi> has not acted like an honeſt man, or a good Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot, with a great deal of pleaſure, ſaw <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> do juſtice to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Divine, and attentivly heard them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any interruption. But, yet, he cou'd not forbear making them obſerve an important thing, for the full juſtification of <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> Take notice, ſayd he to them, that he there diſcourſes only of a ſum of mony, wherewith lay-men have a right to better their eſtates and condition, and which is not ſuperfluous to them on that account, as it wou'd be to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd perſons; and that all this has no relation to ordinary alms, which is a quite different caſe. I will make this matter plain to you.</p>
                  <p>Thô a King ſhou'd give a hundred Louis d'or's a week to the poor; and a man of thirty thouſand livers rent ſpend ten Piſtols a month in alms, they wou'd not, regularly ſpeaking, ſtrip themſelves of any thing neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:174113:134"/>or raiſe their ſtate and condition. Such a ſum cou'd not hinder the Prince from forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his frontier towns, nor from increaſing his fleet, nor the man of thirty thouſand livers rent from purchaſing a new office, for ſome one of his family; and by conſequence thoſe ſmall ſums are to be allow'd ſuperfluous to their ſtate and grandeur; ſo that this was not the matter in debate. Now thô <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſhou'd, with <hi>Cajetan,</hi> found the obligation of alms, upon ſuperfluity, and not upon charity, and the needs of our neighbor; althô he ſhou'd not oblige the rich, as, in ſome circumſtances, he do's, to ſuccor his neighbor, even out of what is neceſſary for maintaining his eſtate and condition; yet wou'd the obligation of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary alms always remain. For from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is a queſtion of one, two, three, or four Louis's, for the preventing, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, an Artiſan from being broken, and his family undon, for want of being able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the neceſſary tools, or inſtruments for carrying on his trade, the rich man, of whom I ſpeak, and to whom this man makes his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and who ſees that his refuſal will ruin the poor unhappy wretch, and his family, is oblig'd in conſcience, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> to give him ſo much alms, as will not deprive himſelf of what is neceſſary for the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or even for the lawful advancement of his ſtate and condition.</p>
                  <p>And yet, notwithſtanding this, what an idea has <hi>Paſcal</hi> given of <hi>Vaſquez?</hi> it is, ſayd he, in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:174113:134"/>expreſs words, that <hi>His Doctrin frees the most rich from giving any alms.</hi> Can there be any thing more diſingenuous or unjuſt?</p>
                  <p>In truth, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander, Paſcal</hi> do's not reaſon right, nor underſtand theſe matters. But that, which has moſt mov'd my indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the obſtinacy and cruelty wherewith he ſtill continues, and purſues his invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Divine. After his ſixth Letter came forth, the Jeſuits made an apology for <hi>Vaſquez;</hi> which conſiſted in a ſhort, plain, expoſition, of his doctrin, in ſubſtance the ſame almoſt you have now heard me make. <hi>Paſcal</hi> replies, and handles again the ſame thing in his twelfth and thirteenth Letters.</p>
                  <p>Rather ſay, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> interrupting him, that he confounds it anew on ſet purpoſe. If I were to make a rejoynder to his reply, and to a thouſand ſuch others, I wou'd do no more than ſo often ſet down the very ſame explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you have now given us of <hi>Vaſquez's</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. This beat's down all before it, and has made all <hi>Paſcal</hi> has ſince ſayd, as well as all he had ſayd before, fall to the ground. If a man be never ſo little skil'd in Divinity, he will quickly perceive, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> underſtands it not; or rather that he will not underſtand what he pretends to refute. But before we go farther, have ſo much goodneſs, I pray you, as to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy me about two new proofs, he has added in his twelfth and thirteenth Letters, to ſhew that the practice of the precept of alms, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the principles of <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:174113:135"/>to nothing. Firſt, ſays he, becauſe he do's not oblige men to give alms in <hi>ordinary neceſſities:</hi> Secondly, becauſe he adds after ſome deciſions, <hi>Hoc intelligo &amp; caetera omnia, quando ſcio nullum opem laturum. Can it then,</hi> ſays <hi>Paſcal, often happen, that in</hi> Paris, <hi>where there are ſo many charitable perſons, it may be known, that none will be found to ſuccor the poor man who begs it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt reproch, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a ſcurvy equivocation; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is meer ſophiſtry and perfect wrangling. To find out the equivocation, you are to know, that <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> with all other Divines, makes a diſtinction of three degrees of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, wherein our neighbor may be, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to alms;
<note place="margin">Cap. 1. num. 9.</note> one is call'd <hi>extream,</hi> the other <hi>great</hi> or <hi>preſſing,</hi> and the third <hi>common</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. <hi>Neceſſitas extrema, gravis ſeu urgens, &amp; communis. Extream</hi> neceſſity, is, not only, when a man is at the point of dying if he gets no alms, but, alſo, when there is ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that, probably, he will be reduc'd to this condition. The neceſſity call'd, <hi>great</hi> or <hi>preſſing,</hi> is, when there is reaſon to apprehend your neighbor is in danger, not of death, but of ſome conſiderable dammage, or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Common</hi> neceſſity is, that, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly an infinity of poor people ſuffer, whoſe poverty puts them into no danger of death, or ſickneſs; ſuch, for example are thoſe, who are ordinarily call'd the poor; who have no way to live but by begging, whereby, however, they make a ſhift to ſupport themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:174113:135"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaſquez</hi> teaches, that the precept do's not only oblige, under pain of mortal ſin in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſitys, as ſome famous Divines ſeem'd to have taught, but that it obliges alſo, in <hi>great</hi> or <hi>preſſing</hi> neceſſities. As to <hi>common</hi> neceſſities, he follows the opinion of the greateſt part of Divines, who hold, that, in this reſpect, the precept do's not oblige under pain of mortal ſin. And that a rich man, going along the ſtreet, do's not ſin mortally in not giving alms to all the beggers who ask him.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of the term <hi>common neceſſities, Paſcal</hi> was pleas'd to ſubſtitute that of <hi>ordinary neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities;</hi> that he might be able to ſay, <hi>Vaſquez</hi> had made void the precept of alms, by aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it do's not oblige in <hi>ordinary neceſſities.</hi> But who is it, that cannot ſee the malice of ſuch a tranſlation? for althô the neceſſity, which is call'd common, in the notion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, be ordinary, 'tis not the only neceſſity that is ſo. <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>preſſing</hi> neceſſities, in which, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> the precept do's oblige, are neither extraordinary, nor very rare. Laſt year, by the ſcarcity of corn, they were become very ordinary; they are this year alſo more ordinary, and the beſt years that can happen, they are never very rare.</p>
                  <p>There is always an infinit number of modeſt, baſhful, poor, who have much more need of aſſiſtance than common beggers; and for this reaſon it is, that the Divines ſay, a rich man is not oblig'd, ſtrictly ſpeaking, under pain of mortal ſin, to give alms to all the beggers he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:174113:136"/>meets. Nevertheleſs many, and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> among others, oblige, under pain of mortal ſin, to ſuccor thoſe other poor in their preſſing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; and thus you ſee it is to abuſe unjuſtly and maliciouſly the term <hi>neceſſitates communes,</hi> to draw that conſequence from it, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> has done againſt <hi>Vaſquez.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When a man is once engag'd, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> interrupting him, he catches at any thing, and ſtrives, as well as he can, to bring himſelf off. What wou'd the world have ſayd, if <hi>Paſcal</hi> had made no reply to the Jeſuits, who brag'd and publiſh'd, that they had convinc'd him of a notorious impoſture?</p>
                  <p>The other article, continu'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> is a pittiful, wrangling, buſineſs. <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> by theſe words, <hi>Hoc intelligo, quando ſcio nullum opem laturum,</hi> meant no more but this, that if I know another will relieve this poor man, I am not then, under pain of mortal ſin, oblig'd to ſuccor him. <hi>Paſcal</hi> thereupon argues ſtrongly; can it often happen, ſayd he, that in <hi>Paris,</hi> where there are ſo many charitable perſons, one ſhou'd know, that no body wou'd be found to aſſiſt the poor we meet? as if <hi>Vaſquez</hi> had intended, that before a rich man was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to give alms, all the Ladies, who make it their buſineſs to beg for the poor, and all the other charitable perſons of <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> ſhould come and make before him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in form of law, that no body wou'd receive the unfortunat wretch, who now beg'd his commiſeration.</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:174113:136"/>
                  <p>But cou'd <hi>Paſcal</hi> have once thought to have made ſo frivolous an objection as that, if he had read <hi>Vaſquez's</hi> treatiſe with any attention? For, in the ſecond chapter, he teaches in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, <hi>That if many rich perſons know a poor mans neceſſities, and do not ſuccor him, they are all guilty of ſin; becauſe every particular perſon is oblig'd to relieve him; and that it is ridiculous to think the contrary.</hi> It is not therefore <hi>Vaſquez's</hi> opinion, that a rich man may take his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from others, unleſs he know that thoſe others will effectually ſuccor the poor man.</p>
                  <p>This is not worth the refutation, anſwer'd the Abbot; you only find by it, that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits are not to be pardon'd in any thing. Their Adverſaries lay hold of every thing; and let no advantage againſt them ſlip; there is not a word, nor an expreſſion, never ſo little doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, upon which they do not think they have a right to cavil and wrangle with them. Such a thing as this cannot but be a great prejudice to their cauſe, but to their adverſaries wou'd be but a very ſlight one.</p>
                  <p>And to confirm what we ſay, continu'd the Abbot, a moment after <hi>Paſcal</hi> had given the Jeſuit, who ſpeaks in his Provincial Letters, this character of extravagant impertinence, do but obſerve, how he makes him conclude this article in his ſixth Letter. <q>I ſee plainly, Father, that this follows from <hi>Vaſquez's</hi> doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. But what can be anſwer'd if it ſhou'd be objected, that to ſecure Salvation, it wou'd be as ſafe, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> to have am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:174113:137"/>enuff to hinder ſuperfluities, as it is ſafe, according to the Goſpel, to have no ambition, that men might give alms out of their ſuperfluities? it muſt be anſwer'd, ſayd he to me, that both theſe ways are ſafe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel. The one, according to the Goſpel, in the moſt literal and moſt eaſy ſenſe; the other, according to the ſame Goſpel interpreted by <hi>Vaſquez;</hi> by which you may perceive the great uſefulneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is in this anſwer, ſayd the Abbot, a moſt ridiculous extravagance; and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all the bounds of probability. But you know the diviſion that is commonly made on ſuch like occaſions. One part of the folly is attributed to the character of the perſon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and the exceſs, or other part belongs, by conſent of all the world, to the author. That which follows, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> relates to the Popes Bulls, I deſir'd my Canoniſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went from him, to inſtruct me in the matter, for I found his learning might ſave me a great deal of trouble. The matter I had a mind to hear debated was, to know upon what occaſions a Religious man might put off the habit of his Order, without hazard of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Of this affair <hi>Paſcals</hi> Jeſuit ſpeaks after this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Popes have excommunicated Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous who put off their habits, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our four and twenty old men diſcourſe thus upon that ſubject, <hi>tr.</hi> 6. <hi>ex.</hi> 7.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:174113:137"/>
                        <hi>nu.</hi> 103. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what occaſions may a Religious man put off his habit, without incurring the penalties of excommunication?</hi> he gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of many; and among others of this. <hi>If he puts it off upon a ſhameful account, as to go a robbing, or to go incognito into places of debauch, with an intention to put it on again preſently after.</hi> So that it is viſible the Bulls did not mean ſuch caſes as theſe. I cou'd hardly believe this was poſſible; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayd the Father to ſhew it me in the original. And I ſaw that the chapter where theſe words are, is intitled, <hi>The practice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Jeſuits School,</hi> wherein I read theſe words: <hi>Si habitum dimittat ut furetur occultè, vel fornicetur.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what advantage, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, cou'd the Jeſuits have by treating ſuch kind of rogues ſo civilly? I do not ſee their end in this kind of policy: and thô their Divines ſhou'd be as extravagant as <hi>Paſcal</hi> wou'd have us believe, this exception is, of it ſelf, too odd to let us think they cou'd have made it, if it had not been grounded upon ſome maxim of the law, or upon ſome clauſe of the Bull.</p>
                  <p>You judge very prudently, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and my Canoniſt told me upon this occaſion, that <hi>Paſcal,</hi> having ſo fully ſtudied his <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> muſt be ſuppos'd to have found little or nothing in him worthy of reprehenſion; ſince he ſtood ſo much upon ſuch frivolous things. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore explain'd the buſineſs to me in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:174113:138"/>there are, ſays he, many decrees againſt Religious, who put off their habits, and go out of their Cloiſters, without their ſuperiors leave. The chapter here treated of,
<note place="margin">In ſexto titulo. Ne Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vel Monachi</note> is, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t periculoſa,</hi> which forbids the Religious, upon pain of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, raſhly to quit their habits, to go to the public Schooles, or to any other places. The Canoniſt put the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by vertue of this chapter, every Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, from the moment he puts off his habit, incurs the penalty of excommunication. And they do all anſwer, that this decree, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all others, ought to be underſtood, according to the intention of the Legiſlator; that is to ſay of the Pope, who made it: whoſe intention appears by theſe words, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t periculoſa Religioſts evagandi materia ſubtrahatur: To the end, an occaſion may be taken from the Religious, of running out of their Cloiſters, to the danger of their Salvation.</hi> So that a Religious man, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes himſelf, and in that dreſs go's out of his Monaſtery, to walk and divert himſelf, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated; therefore by a much ſtronger reaſon, a Religious man, who lays aſide his habit, <hi>to rob, or go incognito to baudy houſes,</hi> wou'd, without doubt, incur the penalty of excommunication.</p>
                  <p>This being ſuppos'd, the Canoniſt ſets down ſeveral occaſions, wherein a Religious man may put off his habit, without hazard of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; ſome, wherein he may do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, and others, without mortal ſin. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to this, <hi>Eſcobar</hi> puts this queſtion,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:174113:138"/>
                     <hi>Quandonam Religioſus poteſt ſine excommunicatione habitum exuere?</hi> and he anſwers, that in the following caſes he do's not incur excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If he lays aſide his habit but for his eaſe, either to leap, or run, in ſome place, where no body can ſee him, <hi>Si in loco ſecreto exuat ut commodius ei ſit, vel ut melius cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t vel ſaltet.</hi> 2. If being oppreſs'd by his immediat ſuperior, he diſguiſe himſelf, that he may go with more ſecurity to find out his mediat ſuperior. <hi>Vel ſi injuſtè gravatus à Praelato immediato fugiat ad Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorem ſine habitu, ne agnitus comprehendatur.</hi> 3. Or, if he ſhou'd quit his habit upon ſome criminal deſign, for example, privatly to rob, or, to do ſomething worſe, with an intention quickly to put it on agen. <hi>Vel ſi ad turpem cauſam, v. g. ut furetur occultè vel fornicetur, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum dimittat mox reaſſumpturus.</hi> And theſe are his laſt words, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> was pleas'd to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, or rather to paraphraſe thus, if he lays it aſide for a ſhameful cauſe, as to go a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, or incognito to a baudy houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is very plain, that this was not at all <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> ſenſe or meaning.</p>
                  <p>For his deſign by theſe exceptions, and theſe examples, is to inſtruct a Confeſſor, in the exact and preciſe ſenſe of the decree; which only prohibits Religious men from changing their habits to go out of the Monaſtery and to live or act abroad with greater liberty, and by which the Pope had no thoughts of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating one, who ſhou'd only lay aſide his
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:174113:139"/>habit in the Convent, althô he ſhou'd do it even with an ill and diſhoneſt intention.</p>
                  <p>I reply'd to my Canoniſt, that what he ſayd, appear'd probable enuff, but that <hi>Paſcals</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe alſo did not ſeem very unreaſonable, nor ill grounded. For thô a Religious man might put off his habit, to rob within the Monaſtery, becauſe, for example, he was to paſs thrô ſome hole, where his habit might be troubleſome, it is very rare that he cou'd commit the other ſin within the Convent; and therefore <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſeem'd to have a right to interpret, as he has done, <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> text and meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> ſayd he to me, writ in a time, when that was not ſo rare as you imagin, even here in <hi>France,</hi> in ſeveral Monaſteries in the country, which have been ſince reform'd; but, ſayd he farther, <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> book, cited by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> is but an abridgment by way of queſtion and anſwer. I'le ſhew you this Divine's ſenſe clear'd and explain'd at large upon this point of the Canon law. It is in the third volume of his Moral Divinity.
<note place="margin">Tom. 7. p. 144.</note> There, after he had ſet down the text of the chapter <hi>ut periculoſa, Eſcobar</hi> ſays poſitively, that from the moment a Religious man quits his habit, to conceal what he is, he incurs the cenſure of excommunication, and that, thô he ſhou'd not take another, althô he ſhou'd keep a part, quitting, for example, the upper garment, without putting off the under, yet, notwithſtanding, if this be ſufficient to hinder him from being known for Religious, he is to be judg'd, according to the intention
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:174113:139"/>of the law, to have quitted his habit. See now, ſayd he, whether this agrees with <hi>Paſcal's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who ſuppoſes the Religious man, a robber on the high-way, or in the ſtreets of <hi>Paris,</hi> and running <hi>incognito to places of looſneſs and debauchery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> but ſtill admire <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal's</hi> ingenuous zeal for the reformation of the Jeſuits doctrin: for, I pray, take notice, that he has choſen ſome caſes and paſſages very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and obſcure on one ſide, and which, on the other, being diſmember'd, and cut off from the text, and propos'd without certain circumſtances, which very few are able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, have ſomething extreamly ſhocking, by which the common people are wholy drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from, and made ready, or prepar'd to riſe up, as it were, in rebellion againſt the Society.</p>
                  <p>You will ſee in what follows, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> a Maſter-piece of this artifice and cunning. It is without doubt a fine ſtroke, and muſt needs have given the Jeſuits a great deal of trouble, under pretenſe of not tranſgreſſing the bounds of good manners, he only points at a paſſage, in <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> relating to a Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> V againſt Prieſts, given to a crime not to be nam'd, but upon great neceſſity. <hi>I ſaw indeed,</hi> ſayd <hi>Paſcal, this paſſage of</hi> Eſcobar <hi>the evening before, but I durſt not tell it you, for it is a friteful thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing is indeed friteful, ſayd my Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, if <hi>Paſcal</hi> intends the matter; for the crime there ſpoken of is one of the moſt infamous, that can be committed; the particulars alſo to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:174113:140"/>which <hi>Eſcobar</hi> deſcends, can hardly be read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome trouble. But cou'd it be imputed as a fault in a Doctor of Phyſic, to hold himſelf oblig'd to expound to his Scholars, certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, about which they might ſome time or other be conſulted? Prudence obliges men to write caſes of conſcience in a language, not commonly underſtood by all the world; and in books which are uſually read by none but Prieſts, employ'd in hearing Confeſſions; who daily meet with worſe things than thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by this author. I fancy if one be guilty in this point, is it not <hi>Paſcal,</hi> who ſets people a laughing to ſee what is not at all proper for them?</p>
                  <p>But if by ſaying, that it is <hi>a friteful thing,</hi> he means <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> deciſion, he ſhews himſelf in this alſo to be either very ignorant, or very malicious. For all that <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſays upon this ſubject, may be reduc'd to this; he gives an account of the opinion of another <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; which is, that this Bull, probably ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is abſolete, and therefore do's not oblige in conſcience to the penalties it impoſes. This is a meer matter of fact, which <hi>Eſcobar</hi> do's not warrant, and, beſides, it is no more ſurpriſing, that this Bull ſhou'd not be receiv'd, or put in practice in <hi>Spain,</hi> than that it ſhou'd not be receiv'd, or put in practice in <hi>France,</hi> where, in reality, it never was.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, ſuppoſing it had been receiv'd, <hi>Eſcobar</hi> explains in what circumſtances it do's, or do's not oblige; and that by an
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:174113:140"/>undoubted principle of law, according to which, the Popes very well know their decrees are always to be underſtood; to wit, that when they ſpeak of any ſin, it is of a ſin perfect, or complete in it's kind, except the contrary be plainly expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, <hi>Eſcobar</hi> adds, that before the Judges declaratory ſentence, the criminals, in the court of conſcience, do not incur the penalties of this Bull. And theſe penalties are, to be depriv'd of their charges, or benefices, if they have any, and to be degraded, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up to the ſecular arm, to be puniſh'd, after the manner of lay-men, that is to ſay to be burnt alive. What <hi>Eſcobar</hi> there ſays, is undeniable, according to the principle he lays down, that no penal law obliges the guilty to accuſe themſelves; and certainly it wou'd be a great, and very particular extravagance to ſay, that a wretch, actually guilty of this ſin, was oblig'd, in conſcience, to go and diſcover himſelf, to the end he might be degraded and burnt alive.</p>
                  <p>This is ridiculous, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> but, I pray you, continu'd he, addreſſing himſelf to the Abbot, ſatisfy me in one thing relating to <hi>Eſcobar.</hi> In this abridgment of Morals, often quoted by <hi>Paſcal, Eſcobar</hi> gives ſome chapters the title of <hi>Praxis circa...... ex Societatis Jeſu Doctoribus,</hi> and after the deciſions, he puts into the margent the names of ſeveral Jeſuit-au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. Are all theſe deciſions, really, taken out of the authors by him cited? This is a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:174113:141"/>matter of conſequence, for a man cannot but conclude from <hi>Paſcal,</hi> that the whole Society ſpeaks by the mouth of <hi>Eſcobar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It wou'd be great injuſtice to all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, reply'd the Abbot, if men ſhou'd make them anſwerable, for all that <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſays in thoſe chapters. 1. Becauſe, that in many Moral points, it is the ſame thing with the Jeſuits, as with other Divines, Canoniſts, and Lawyers; one is of one opinion, another of another, and therefore it wou'd be nonſenſe, to take <hi>Eſcobar's</hi> doctrin, for the doctrin of the Society; becauſe he might, for example, have follow'd <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> ſo long as <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Laiman</hi> are of a contrary opinion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Eſcobar</hi> commonly thinks it ſufficient, to make one of theſe authors ſupport his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he finds in him, the principle, from whence he imagins he has rightly infer'd his own concluſion: wherein he is not more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, than other Divines, who are often miſtaken in their arguments; and indeed <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> himſelf, do's ſometimes miſtake in that matter. 3. <hi>Eſcobar</hi> is a great Collector, not very exact, and for want of care, often quotes falſly; witneſs the caſe of faſting, which we have already mention'd; wherein he cites <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liucius,</hi> and yet <hi>Filiucius</hi> ſays not one word, of what he makes him ſpeak in his margent.</p>
                  <p>As far as I ſee, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> interrupting him, if the Jeſuits had the ſame notion, you have, of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> they wou'd not treat him with much ceremony, but freely give him up to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:174113:141"/>
                     <hi>Paſcals</hi> cenſure and diſcretion. Nor do I know, whether even <hi>Bauni</hi> wou'd find any great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from you, at leaſt, if I may judge by what I have formerly heard you ſpeak of him, and that without any reference to the Provincial Letters.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſay ſo, anſwer'd the Abbot, they are both men of merit, and commonly argue, and decide very well; I wou'd only ſay, that in ſome places, they either miſtook, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd themſelves ſcurvily; and that there was reaſon to reprehend them, provided they wou'd treat them in their reprehenſions, after the ſame manner, they wou'd treat Divines of any other Body or Order; and that the Jeſuits, far from adopting the doctrin of theſe authors, did reject it, conformably to the opinions of their beſt Divines; among whom theſe are far from being reckoned of the firſt form.</p>
                  <p>But if it be unjuſt, to judge by theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of the remaining part of theſe two Divines doctrin, 'tis yet much more unjuſt, to do it for the whole Society. As there is no author in whom faults may not be found, ſo are there none, who may not be defam'd by publiſhing nothing but their faults; exaggerating and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them on all occaſions, without ever mentioning what is good in their books. And as there is no body, whoſe members are all ſound and without fault; ſo can there be none, which, under the like pretence, may not be decry'd and run down. But, ſayd the Abbot, we are inſenſibly gone aſtray from our ſubject.</p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:174113:142"/>
                  <p>That which follows for the moſt part in this ſixth Letter, continu'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> has no relation to the Jeſuits, but to <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Caramuel,</hi> who are not of their number. Let us paſs by all that, and come to <hi>Valentia,</hi> upon his caſe of ſimony. You, ſayd he to <hi>Cleander,</hi> are to make a report of this matter.</p>
                  <p>Let us firſt do <hi>Paſcal</hi> juſtice, ſayd the Abbot interrupting them, and let us own, that ſo very nice and tender a point, cou'd not be touch'd more finely than it has been by him; and upon which it was, for him, of the laſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to turn his readers fancy. It is about half a page before the caſe of <hi>Valentia,</hi> in your edition <hi>in quarto.</hi> I pray liſten to it attentively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Alas! ſayd the Father to me; our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end was no other, but to have eſtabliſh'd the Goſpel maxims in their utmoſt ſeverity; and it is ſufficiently ſeen by our conduct, and the regulation of our manners, that if we ſuffer any relaxation, or looſneſs in others 'tis more by condeſcendance, than deſign, to which we are forc'd; the men of this age being ſo much corrupted, that finding our ſelves unable to make them come to us, we are neceſſitated to go to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſcal</hi> very well foreſaw, that the behavior of the Jeſuits, their ordinary way of living, and the <hi>regulation of their manners,</hi> which he was willing to acknowlege, wou'd be a ſtrong prejudice, and a general objection againſt the belief of thoſe horrid things, wherewith he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reproch them. He was ſenſible, that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:174113:142"/>they always had been, and ſtill were, in ſo good a reputation in the world, that, till the appearance of the Provincial Letters, all which had been ſayd againſt them, and ſo often pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by their enemies in <hi>France, Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> had made no great impreſſion upon the men of ſenſe, even upon thoſe, who were the leaſt favorable to the Society.</p>
                  <p>And, really, when the Provincial Letters come firſt out, an infinity of honeſt people ſayd, that the regularity of theſe Fathers lives, was, alone, a ſufficient apology for them. That there was not the leaſt liklyhood, or probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that a Society, where vice is leſs ſuffer'd than in any other, and where, the manners and behavior of the particular members are commonly very regular, and exact, ſhou'd think of introducing, or countenancing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the world; that it is natural enuff, to be eaſy and indulgent to ones ſelf, however ſevere a man is to others; that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 'tis not man's temper to be rigid and ſevere to himſelf, and ſoft and gentle to his neighbor. And in the laſt place, that it was hard to conceive, that ſo many perſons, who, on one hand, did all a Chriſtian, or a Religious man can do to be ſav'd, ſhou'd, on the other, in favor of ſinners, do that, which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily dam both themſelves and thoſe ſinners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſcal</hi> foreſaw this difficulty, and was aware of it, even when he writ his fourth Letter; wherein he firſt began to attack the Jeſuits, and did then, all he cou'd to leſſen the force
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:174113:143"/>of this prejudice and argument againſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all he ſhou'd ſay upon that ſubject. He do's here agen the ſame thing, as you ſee, and that in a very cunning, skilful, manner; and it was, without doubt, ſuch places as theſe, which made your Acadamiſt <hi>Perault</hi> ſay, <hi>that all the art of Dialogue was to be found in the Provincial Letters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> agreed to the truth of this remark; and that there was in this tranſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> as much wit as malice, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado fell upon the paſſage in <hi>Valentia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> the reaſon, why in the ſeveral editions I have ſeen of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters, the citations upon this article are ſo faulty, and the pages in <hi>Valentia</hi> quoted with ſo little exactneſs. I thought it was done, by miſtake, which oblig'd me to read, at length, this Divines treatiſe of ſimony; but before I tell you my opinion on't, let us read <hi>Paſcal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We have therefore maxims for all ſorts of perſons; for the benefic'd, for Prieſts, for Religious, and for Gentlemen ...... Let us begin, ſayd the Father, with the benefic'd perſons. You know the trade, that is, at this day, driven about benefices; wherein if we ſhou'd govern our ſelves, by what Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and old authors have written upon this ſubject, abundance of Church-men wou'd be found guilty of ſimony: for which reaſon it was very neceſſary, that our Fathers ſhou'd, by their prudence, moderat things,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:174113:143"/>as theſe words of <hi>Valentia,</hi> who is one of <hi>Eſcobars</hi> four animals, will give you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. It is the concluſion of a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein he ſets down many expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, of which, in my opinion, that in the 1042 page of the third tome is the beſt. <hi>If a temporal good be given for a ſpiritual, that is to ſay, mony for a benefice, and the mony be given as the price of the benefice, 'tis plain down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſimony: but if it be given only as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to induce a man to reſigne,</hi> NON TAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAM PRETIUM BENEFICII SED TANQUAM MOTIVUM AD RESIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANDUM, <hi>it is not ſimony; althô the perſon, who reſignes, conſiders and expects the mony, as his principal end Tanner,</hi> who is alſo of our Society, ſays the ſame thing in his third tome page 1519, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I expected, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> to have found, at large, this concluſion in <hi>Valentia,</hi> and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the ſeven or eight lines of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, written in <hi>Italick</hi> characters, were but the tranſlation of that concluſion. But I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed buſied to good purpoſe, to ſeek for't in the chapter or third point quoted by <hi>Paſcal.</hi> This paraphraſe, is ſo different from the text, that, in good earneſt, I cou'd not gueſs to what part of the treatiſe it had relation. For <hi>Paſcal,</hi> having in his <hi>French</hi> mix'd theſe latin words, <hi>Non tanquam pretium beneficij, ſed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam motivum ad reſignandum,</hi> I did believe he deſign'd it for a mark, to find out, the more eaſily, the place he meant to ſpeak of. But
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:174113:144"/>I ſought for it in vain, not being able any where to find it. <hi>Paſcal</hi> alſo ſays, that what we have now read, <hi>is the concluſion of a long diſcourſe, where</hi> Valentia <hi>gives many expedients to ſhew, how men may trade in benefices without ſin;</hi> but neither cou'd I by this mark find out the place he intended to ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, by gueſſing, I thought I had found, what he wou'd be at: it is in the beginning of the third chapter, where <hi>Valentia</hi> puts this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; <hi>Whether ſimony be committed, as often as a ſpiritual good is given for a temporal, or a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral for a ſpiritual?</hi> and he anſwers, <hi>that to do ſo, is not always ſimony. It must be ſayd,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd he, <hi>and it is the common opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that there are, generally ſpeaking, two ways, by which it may happen, that men may give a ſpiritual good for a temporal without ſimony. The firſt is, when the temporal good, is, only, a motive of giving, or of doing ſome ſpiritual good. The ſecond is, when the temporal, is, but a gratful acknowlegment, or compenſation of the ſpiritual good, or the ſpiritual of the temporal.</hi> He proves his aſſertion, by the notion of ſimony; which he takes, as all Divines do, for a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, after which he adds theſe words, <hi>The concluſion therefore of my argument is eſtabliſh'd, or confirm'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had, I ſay, reaſon to believe, purſu'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> in reading his ſixth Letter, that this was the place <hi>Paſcal</hi> principally pointed at. 1. Becauſe, that <hi>Valentia</hi> there, really, anſwer'd the queſtion propounded; that it is not always
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:174113:144"/>ſimony to give a temporal good for a ſpiritual, nor a ſpiritual for a temporal. 2. Becauſe, he ſpeaks of the diſtinction, of two ways of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a temporal for a ſpiritual good, as a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or as a motive. 2. Becauſe he adds theſe words, <hi>See my concluſion establiſh'd or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,</hi> to which <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſeems to allude; and laſtly becauſe I can find no place, to which the quotation can better agree.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the anſwers, and the replications, and the defenſe of thoſe replications, and the falſe citations, have infinitly puzzled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded this whole affair, I think the beſt and ſhorteſt courſe, is, to do as we have done in the caſe of <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> and other matters; that is to ſay, to examin in it ſelf the doctrin of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia;</hi> and to judge by the expoſition thus to be made, whether this ought to be objected as a crime to the Jeſuits. Now what I have to ſay upon this point is this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſeeing, that in this diſpute, Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> was quoted on both ſides, I thought it fit to read him upon this ſubject; of which he treats in 100 <hi>q.</hi> 2.2. after I had read and compar'd it with <hi>Valentia,</hi> I perceiv'd, that this Divines treatiſe was nothing elſe, almoſt, but a comment upon Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> queſtion; and that this holy man's doctrin, was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what was held by this Divine.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, I obſerv'd, that in the places where the matter is handled, <hi>Valentia,</hi> without determing any way the queſtion about benefices, treats the thing in general, to wit,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:174113:145"/>whether a ſpiritual good may be ſometime given for a temporal, without ſimony, or a temporal for a ſpiritual; and that all he there do's, and the only thing, almoſt, is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, with Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> how notwithſtanding the precepts which forbids ſimony, a temporal good may be often given, according to ſome cuſtoms, allow'd by all the world for a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good: how it is not ſimony in the Church Miniſters to receive mony, on account of their ſpiritual adminiſtrations. How it is not ſimony to bequeath a fund to a Church for an annual Maſs. How a Church is not guilty of ſimony, by engaging to ſay an <hi>Obit</hi> or Maſs, for thoſe who give ſuch, or ſuch, an alms, or offering. And alſo how mony may be given, for certain, ſacred, and ſpiritual actions. Upon this laſt point, <hi>Valentia</hi> directs his reader to Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> 3. <hi>art.</hi> where he has for examples the giving mony to the poor, to engage them to pray to God for us, the giving mony for Proceſſions to get Prayers ſayd for the dead, and other ſuch like matters.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Valentia,</hi> by the diſtinction which at firſt he mention'd, <hi>of a temporal good given for a ſpiritual, as a motive, or gratful acknowlegment,</hi> explains how the retributions for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miniſters of the Church are given, and receiv'd, without ſimony: and how they may in conſcience take them, becauſe they are given, not in payment, but by way of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowlegment.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, he ſays, that a fund be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:174113:145"/>to a Church, on condition of a Maſs, the mony given for Proceſſions, the alms given to the poor, on condition to have their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all receiv'd, without ſimony; becauſe given, but as motives, to engage thoſe, who accept them, to pray and do theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duties for the givers. In all this, added <hi>Cleander,</hi> not only, nothing appears falſe, but it alſo ſeems to me, that no body cou'd do, or ſpeak otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, ſince it is principally upon the direction of intention, and upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of a thing given, as a motive, or grateful acknowlegment, and not as a payment, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> attacks <hi>Valentia,</hi> to give his doctrin an ill air, or make men take up a bad opinion of it, I was deſirous to ſee, whether theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, and directions of intentions, were, as well as the reſt, taken out of Saint <hi>Thomas;</hi> and I found all this was purely the doctrin of this learned and holy man. Hereupon, <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> opening one of Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> Sums, ſhew'd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> examples in it, almoſt, upon all the articles of the queſtion.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>To receive any thing given for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of ſpiritual matters,

                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>To exact theſe retributions approv'd by cuſtom, is not ſimony,
<note place="margin">Ad. 4.</note> provided the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be directed only to the obſervation of the cuſtom.</p>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:174113:146"/>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays the ſame thing yet more fully in the following article;
<note place="margin">In concl. &amp; in corp. ad 2.</note> as for the mony given to the poor it muſt be anſwer'd, that thoſe who give them alms, to the end they may pray for them, do it not, with an intention to purchaſe their Prayers, but only out of a principle of liberality, and as a motive to engage them to pray to God for them .... The proceſſion made at a funeral,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> is judg'd a grateful compenſation for the mony given.</p>
                     <p>It is not lawful for the admiſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
<note place="margin">Ad 4.</note> to take or exact any thing, as a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it is, notwithſtanding, lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſomething, if the Monaſtery be poor ... In like manner, it is lawful to be the more eaſy, in receiving a perſon, who, by giving great alms to the Monaſtery, ſhews he has a great deal of devotion for that place.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>But above all, mind what follows, ſayd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, It is alſo lawful, to excite this perſon, by temporal good turns or offices, to have a devotion for this Monaſtery; to the end he may be inſpir'd and inclin'd to enter into it; althô it be not lawful to make a bargain to receive, or give any thing for his admiſſion.</hi> If <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> inſtead of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> had made this diſtinction, and allow'd this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of intention, <hi>Paſcal</hi> wou'd not have paſs'd it by, nor fail'd to have ſoon found a place in the Provincial Letters for theſe laſt lines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cleander,</hi> after he had read all theſe paſſages to <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and the Abbot, purſu'd the point in this manner. I do confeſs to you, that after I had compar'd Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Valentia's</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:174113:146"/>I was enrag'd to ſee, that the moſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal part of theſe diſtinctions, was attributed to <hi>Valentia,</hi> thô he had but tranſcrib'd it out of Saint <hi>Thomas.</hi> But I was yet more enrag'd at <hi>Paſcal's</hi> citation, and way of reporting <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's</hi> text. Who, having with Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſayd, that a ſpiritual good might be given for a temporal, or a temporal, for a ſpiritual, and prov'd it by the ſame examples this holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had made uſe of, is nevertheleſs made by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> to ſpeak in this manner. If a ſpiritual good be given for a temporal, that is to ſay mony for a benefice, and that the mony be given as the price of the benefice, it is plain, downright, ſimony; but if it be given, only, as a motive, to induce the benefic'd perſon to reſign, <hi>Non tanquam pretium beneficij ſed tanquam motivum ad reſignandum</hi> it is no ſimony.</p>
                  <p>Who cou'd believe, but that theſe are the very words of <hi>Valentia,</hi> ſeeing them not only put down in an <hi>Italian</hi> character, but that the Latin words, alſo, are inſerted with the French <hi>Non tanquam pretium benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ij, ſed tanquam motiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ad reſignandum,</hi> as if they had been the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own text, joyn'd with the tranſlation? and yet, notwithſtanding, this Latin propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, altogether, an impudent contrivance of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> or his friends, there not being the leaſt footſtep of it in any part of the whole treatiſe of <hi>Valentia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> extreamly ſurpris'd, ſayd, that this cou'd not poſſibly be; for which reaſon he himſelf reſolv'd to read over, exactly, the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:174113:147"/>chapter pointed at by <hi>Paſcal;</hi> where having found nothing like his quotation; ſee, ſays he, crying out the height and perfection of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and impoſture. I perceive, purſu'd he, clearly, the cheat. This principle, <hi>that a ſpiritual good may be ſometimes given for a temporal,</hi> being once layd down and nakedly applied to the matter of benefices, has ſomething in it very odious: for which cauſe <hi>Paſcal</hi> was pleas'd to give his commentary this turn.</p>
                  <p>But why did not the Jeſuits then take the advantage of ſuch a falſification? for it is very viſible, groſs, and full of affectation; it was not, only, an unfaithful tranſlation, whereby the authors thoughts were made weaker, or a ſtrain'd ſenſe put upon his expreſſions, but whole lines were falſly father'd on him, and Latin words, inſerted in the French, which are not to be found in the text, pretended to be tranſlated. Here are many eſſential words, both French and Latin added, which from a very harmleſs principle, makes a moſt ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous propoſition.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuits, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> inſtead of making, as we have done, a plain, ſimple, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, of <hi>Valentia's</hi> doctrin, compar'd with the doctrin of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> amus'd themſelves with diſtinctions; which, in reality, were good, but not at all neceſſary. Whereupon their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, quitting <hi>Valentia,</hi> began to wrangle and quarrel with them; and thereby ſtarting a new game, cheated and deluded them, but, as you very well ſay, they ought to have been
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:174113:147"/>more ſtanch, made uſe of that occaſion and ſtuck preciſely to the matter of fact. They ſhou'd have oblig'd the Janſeniſts, to have ſhewn in <hi>Valentia,</hi> the words cited by <hi>Paſcal;</hi> however ſuch men, after ſuch a cheat as this, are unworthy of any anſwer, till they have made public ſatisfaction by owning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deming the tric. But this, in all appearance, they will be careful not to do.</p>
                  <p>I have upon this point, ſayd the Abbot, confounded twenty Janſeniſts with the very book in their own hands: you have each of you hit upon the main difficulty, and the moſt eſſential part of the calumny. For in as much, as the application of <hi>Valentia</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> principle to the matter, to which they apply'd it, is very reaſonable, and in as much, as the application they make of it, is neceſſary for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Eccleſiaſtics, how to purify and raiſe up their intentions, in ſuch holy Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo much the more impious and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous wou'd this principle be, and ſo much the more dangerous in the matter, to which it is apply'd by <hi>Paſcal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man ſhou'd ſay to a poor body, here I'le give you a crown, on condition you'l pray to God for me; and that another ſhou'd ſay to a benefic'd perſon, Sir your living is worth fifteen hundred livers a year, give it me, here are for you ten thouſand livers in ready mony; which I do not offer you as the price of your benefice, I have no ſuch thoughts, but only as a motive to engage you to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:174113:148"/>me with it. Can any thing be more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent than theſe two propoſitions, any thing more innocent than the firſt, or more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant than the ſecond? the firſt is a common practice among Chriſtians; clearly juſtify'd by the doctrin of <hi>Valentia;</hi> upon whom the ſecond is groſly impos'd; which is as far from his thoughts as light is from darkneſs, or truth from error. This learned Divine maintains, that it is not always forbid, to give a ſpiritual good for a temporal; and he proves this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by declaring expreſly, that that, which obliges him, and all other Divines to hold this opinion, is, that, otherwiſe, the cuſtom, univerſally receiv'd in the Church, muſt be condem'd; purſuant to which, the ſpiritual ſervices, render'd to the people by the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics, are done on condition of certain tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral retributions, which ſerve for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Miniſters of the Altar.

                     <hi>In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium autem eſt, quod ſi ita eſſet, oporteret dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare univerſalem uſum Eccleſiae, quo ferè quidquid ſpiritualis miniſterij confertur in populum, confertur pro aliquibus ſubſidijs temporalibus, quibus Miniſtri alantur.</hi> He explains, at the ſame time, how ſimony is avoided, upon theſe occaſions, that is by giving a temporal good for a ſpiritual, not as the price, or payment, but only as a grateful compenſation, or recognition, or as a motive whereby the perſon, out of a principle of gratitude, is engag'd, to grant the ſpiritual good, intended to be obtain'd by the temporal.</p>
                  <p>Durſt <hi>Paſcal</hi> contend or diſpute, that thus to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:174113:148"/>give a temporal for a ſpiritual good, was not an uſual cuſtom among Chriſtians, or that this uſage was not lawful and innocent; or, laſtly, that a man ought not to have the intentions <hi>Valentia</hi> ſuggeſts, and to exclude thoſe, which he do's exclude in this matter. Durſt he ſay, that from <hi>Valentia's</hi> principle, determin'd and reſtrain'd to the ſubject treated of by him and by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> it might be concluded law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to give mony for a benefice? let him therefore make Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf ſpeak, as he has made <hi>Valentia,</hi> and the whole Church ſay, whoſe cuſtom we ſee is founded upon this principle of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and only ſanctifi'd by the intentions preſcrib'd by this Divine to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and to the Miniſters of the Altar; that their practice is to be extended much farther, than the principle it ſelf. But to argue and ſpeak exactly well upon this ſubject, it is neceſſary to ſtudy it, much better than <hi>Paſcal</hi> has done.</p>
                  <p>The Divines, after Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> example, eſtabliſh'd the diſtinction of a temporal good given, as a motive, or as a payment; but it was only to be made uſe of in fit and capable matters; and in ſuch inſtances, as we have already mention'd. It may, alſo, ſometimes, take place in the matter of benefices; as in that particular caſe, which neither Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> nor <hi>Valentia</hi> have forgot.</p>
                  <p>A Biſhop has receiv'd many great ſervices from a perſon, who is neither incapable nor unworthy to enjoy a benefice: the Biſhop
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:174113:149"/>gives him one; in this there may, and there may not, be ſimony. If the Biſhop, out of friendſhip and meer acknowlegment, has done him this favor, it is not ſimony. But if he gives him the benefice, as a recompenſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting him of all obligations to this man, in ſo much that he believes himſelf thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd from paying his ſalary, or the mony he had advanc'd for his ſervice, it is ſimony. So that, let the Biſhop direct his intention never ſo much to the motive of friendſhip or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegment, the benefice is really given for payment. Let but the heart of thoſe, who confer, change, or reſign benefices, be but as right, as the diſtinctions of theſe Divines are reaſonable and ſolid, and they will never be miſtaken: but if the rectitude of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be wanting, and they will but liſten to the dictates of their conſciences, they ſhall ſoon perceive, that theſe diſtinctions, ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, are not ſufficient to ſet them at eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Here is an article, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that has held us a long time, and with reaſon; for there were many things in it to be diſintangled and explain'd. But before we go to another, ſatisfy me in a ſmall matter of fact; which during this diſcourſe, wherein it was often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, has given me ſome trouble, and which I have ſuffer'd to paſs by, that I might not interrupt you. You have ſpoken, ſeveral times, of ſome latin words, inſerted by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> in the quotation of <hi>Valentia's</hi> paſſage, touching the mony one might give to a benefic'd perſon for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:174113:149"/>his benefice, <hi>Non tanquam pretium, ſed tanquam motivum ad reſignandum.</hi> Which I do not find in my edition, and yet, notwithſtanding, it is one of the moſt criminal circumſtances of the citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that which moſt demonſtrates <hi>Paſcals</hi> unfaithfulneſs and diſingenuity.</p>
                  <p>I know it very well, reply'd the Abbot; theſe latin words were retrench'd out of the following editions, after they had wrought in the firſt, all their intended effect. The party were apprehenſive of the bad conſequences of ſuch a falſiſication as this; of which it was very eaſy to convince the author, and upon which, after conviction, it was natural enuff, to make troubleſom and pernicious reflexions; and therefore, without ſaying any thing, they left it out; and I do not believe, that even the Jeſuits did ever perceive it, at leaſt they never complain'd on't. But yet in this edition in <hi>quarto,</hi> you may ſee the words at length. <hi>If a temporal good be given, for a ſpiritual, that is to ſay, mony for a benefice, and that the mony be given, as the price of the benefice, it is plain ſimony. But if it be given only as a motive, to incline the benefic'd perſon to reſign;</hi> NON TAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAM PRETIUM SED TANQUAM MOTIVUM AD RESIGNANDUM, <hi>it is not ſimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If with all the other falſifications, ſayd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus,</hi> which we have hitherto ſeen, upon ſo many different ſubjects, there ſhou'd yet be found ſome other of this ſize and force, I ſhou'd not think there was no ground for the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:174113:150"/>Proverb at that time currant, <hi>He lyes like a Janſeniſt.</hi> But ſhall we be as long employ'd in diſcuſſing the paſſage in <hi>Tanner</hi> another Jeſuit, whom <hi>Paſcal</hi> makes an accomplice in <hi>Valentia's</hi> pretended crime? <hi>Tanner,</hi> added the good Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit in the Provincial Letters, <hi>Tanner, who is ſtill of our Society, ſays the ſame thing, in his third tome page</hi> 1519.</p>
                  <p>No, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> for by reading but one colume, you will ſee they have calumniated him, juſt as they have <hi>Valentia.</hi> They open'd the book, and read him, and except the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propoſition, that it is ſometimes lawful, to give a ſpiritual for a temporal good, they found not one ſingle word, which came near what was attributed to him by <hi>Paſcal.</hi> He expreſſes himſelf, alſo, with more circumſpection than <hi>Valentia</hi> has done: and the deciſions he draws from his principles, do ſo clearly ſhew, he ſpeaks but of the caſes mention'd by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> that he, who pretends to find there any thing elſe, muſt needs be a whimſical, maggotpated fellow.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be acknowleg'd, that this is horrible, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and I cou'd hardly have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it, if I had not ſeen it with my own eyes. But however, continu'd he, it cannot be ſayd, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> was never in the right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jeſuits. And as for my ſelf, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but condem the following deciſion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, a Prieſt, beſides the ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the Maſs, he ſays to the intention of one perſon, may receive from another alſo,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:174113:150"/>about a third part of that retribution, by yielding up to him, the ſhare he himſelf has a right to pretend to, in the fruit, or benefit of the Sacrifice. This deciſion, is in <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> I have compar'd and found <hi>Paſcals</hi> quotation of it true.</p>
                  <p>You wou'd therefore be very much ſurpris'd, ſayd the Abbot, if I ſhou'd tell you, that <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> even by this deciſion, do's combat a relaxation in Morals. I ſhou'd indeed, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> be extreamly ſurpris'd at that: for the queſtion he propoſes in this place, ſeems to me, to be very impertinent, and alſo to be very ill decided.</p>
                  <p>The thing, notwithſtanding, anſwer'd the Abbot, is, as I ſay; and he argues againſt this relaxation, after the example of the holy and learned Canoniſt <hi>Narvar,</hi> whoſe principles and doctrin he follows.
<note place="margin">De celeb. Miſſ. &amp; in Man. cap. 25.</note> This man ſpeaks of ſome Prieſts of his time, who, abuſing what Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſayd, that the ſatisfactory merit of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, is infinit, take mony, without any ceremony, for their Maſs from ſeveral perſons; and pretend by the ſame Maſs, to ſatisfy the obligation they were under, to all thoſe perſons; becauſe, ſayd they, that the Sacrifice, thô offer'd for an infinity of worlds, was an inexhauſtible treaſure of ſatisfactions. This oblig'd Doctor <hi>Navar</hi> to conſider the point; wherein making uſe of all his ſubtlety in Divinity, he diſtinguiſhes that part, which the whole Church has right to pretend to, in every Sacrifice, that which belongs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:174113:151"/>for whom by name it is offer'd, and laſtly that which is peculiar to the Prieſt; of which, ſayd he, he may yet quit to others ſome part.</p>
                  <p>And do you approve of all this, ſayd <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> ſpeaking to the Abbot.</p>
                  <p>No by no means, anſwer'd the Abbot. <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> as well as <hi>Navar,</hi> wou'd have done much better, to have ſet forth in general to the Prieſts, the ſhame and infamy of this mean and ſordid covetouſneſs; which made them act as they did on theſe occaſions, rather than to have ſet down all theſe diſtinctions, of which the practical conſequences can no way agree with the ſpirit of the Church; and this alſo was the ſenſe of the moſt able Jeſuit Divines, as <hi>Suarez, Laiman, de Lugo, Vaſquez, Turrian</hi> and many others; which they very fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, as often as an opportunity offer'd: and theſe perſons, in my opinion, do much better repreſent the Society, than this <hi>Spaniard,</hi> thô ſupported by the diſtinctions of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Navar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was one of the School ſubtleties; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of which if men cry'd out and ſtorm'd a little, I ſhou'd not be ſcandalis'd; provided a judicious choice, and a faithful and exact liſt were made of them; which wou'd be very much ſhorter than is commonly thought; and provided, alſo, they wou'd not falſly give out, that ſubtleties, were the fund, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and as it were the whole quinteſſence of School Divinity; and that, on the contrary, they wou'd give notice, of what is moſt true,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:174113:151"/>that theſe kind of faults are very rare, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of an infinit number of excellent things, very uſeful for the underſtanding of Religion and Chriſtian Morals; which are to be found in this ſort of learning. And, in the laſt place, that the little, which may be reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or rejected, ſhou'd not be wholy put to the account of the Jeſuits; who moſt certainly, to ſay no more, have not a greater ſhare in it, than others.</p>
                  <p>Here is, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> a project of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, very fit to be propounded to ſome, peeviſh, learned men of my acquaintance; who are always in an ill humor againſt the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; the greateſt part of which perſons, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Abbot, never read them; but they ſpeak out of prejudice and prepoſſeſſion; the diſcovery of an Epoch or period of time, by a manuſcript, or a medal, is ſomething more, in their eſteem, than the diſcovery of the <hi>Indies</hi> by the <hi>Portugees.</hi> Shou'd but a Schoolman fall into a miſtake, in ſuch a point as that, it wou'd be, in their opinion, a hanging matter; and always to be puniſh'd with the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But let us return to our ſubject. Do you believe, added he, that <hi>Paſcal</hi> cou'd long keep the character of a ſincere and true judge or cretic? I do not ſay that, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and even Father <hi>Bauni's</hi> three following paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which were joyn'd together, thô taken out of ſeveral places, gave me, at the very firſt, ſome ſuſpicion, which I ſoon perceiv'd was not ill founded.

In one place, in the tenth treatiſe <hi>pa.</hi> 474, he ſays, that a law cannot be made to oblige Curats every day to ſay Maſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a law wou'd, indubitably, <hi>hand dubiè,</hi> expoſe them to the danger of ſaying it ſometimes in a mortal ſin. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the ſame treatiſe <hi>page</hi> 441. he ſays, <hi>That Prieſts, who receive mony for a daily Maſs, ought to ſay Maſs daily, and cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, by their not being always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, becauſe they may always make an act of Contrition, wherein, if they are wanting, it is their own fault, and not the perſons who engag'd them to ſay Maſs.</hi>

                  <p>By reading this, continu'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> I cou'd not conceive, that it was to ſpeak <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> ſo different are the ſubjects here treated of from one another. But, inſtead of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in the paſſages cited, I found out the malice of the perſon, who quoted th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m. f we do but tranſlate the latin, there is in this matter, neither contradiction, extravagance, nor impiety, but all the diſcretion poſſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This is his aſſertion: I ſay in the third place, that when a Prieſt agrees with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay Maſs for him once a year, or
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:174113:153"/>every day, he ſins if he do's not diſcharge this duty, either by himſelf, or by ſome other ....... if therefore he do's not do it, he ought to give back the whole mony to the perſon from whom he firſt receiv'd it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He afterwards makes this objection. <hi>This wou'd be, to put the Prieſt into an almoſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occaſion of ſinning;</hi> to which he makes two anſwers, <hi>Cui argumento duplice hac reſponſione occurritur.</hi> The firſt, <hi>that, by an act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, he may return to God, and if he do's it not, it is his own fault.</hi> This anſwer is not good, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> interrupting him and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt, according to <hi>Paſcal's</hi> principles; for it ſuppoſes, that Grace is not wanting, when, for want of it, a man is unable to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil, or obey the command.</p>
                  <p>For this time, I pray, let us not meddle with Janſeniſme; that is not now our buſineſs, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus.</hi> Harken to the other part of <hi>Bauni's</hi> anſwer. <hi>The ſecond is,</hi> ſayd he, <hi>that a Prieſt, not being oblig'd, by vertue of his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to diſcharge this holy Miniſtry in his own perſon, and being at liberty to do it by another, it depends on him, if he himſelf be not prepar'd, to get Maſs ſayd by another; wherein there is neither ſin nor danger.</hi> What ſay you to that, continu's <hi>Eudoxus?</hi> can any thing be better ſtated, or fuller of ſenſe, than every point of this deciſion? and is not <hi>Paſcal,</hi> think you, a man of honor, for ſuppreſſing, as he has done, the ſecond part of this anſwer, not only to find a contradiction, in what this
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:174113:154"/>Divine has ſayd, but alſo, to let his readers think, that he had, in conſcience, oblig'd the Prieſt to commit Sacrilege?</p>
                  <p>I pray look upon this third paſſage, report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Paſcal.</hi> 
                     <q>May a Prieſt, having firſt been at Confeſſion, ſay Maſs the ſame day he committed one of the worſt of mortal ſins? no, ſayd <hi>Villalobos,</hi> becauſe of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity; but <hi>Sanchez</hi> ſays he may, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſin; whoſe opinion I hold ſafe, and to be follow'd in practice: <hi>&amp; tuta &amp; ſequenda in praxi.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is a bold ſtroke, ſayd <hi>Cleander;</hi> have a little patience anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus;</hi> when I my ſelf firſt read this place in <hi>Bauni,</hi> I was a little ſhock'd, but running over the table of the book, I fell by chance upon a word, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd me to read the ſixth chapter of the fourth treatiſe, whereby I found what his real thought was in this.</p>
                  <p>There he puts the ſame queſtion, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to married perſons, and teaches, that, after even the moſt lawful actions in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the reſpect due to the holy Euchariſt, obliges them, not to approch to it preſently; and that they cannot be wanting in the decency requir'd in order to that myſtery, without ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſin. He adds, that there may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, be reaſons, which may leſſen, or wholy take away the ſin; the ſcandal, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which, in certain circumſtances, might happen, if theſe perſons ſhou'd not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: the ſolemnity of a great feaſt, or the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:174113:154"/>extraordinary deſire of communicating, where with God might inſpire one in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture. Thus it is evident, concluded <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus,</hi> that when <hi>Bauni</hi> ſpeaks of Prieſts and Curats, whoſe duty he particularly treat's of, in the chapter, cited by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> it is but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſome accidents, where the ſin, on one ſide, and the neceſſity of ſaying Maſs on the other, holds them in ſuſpenſe. Whereupon, in the firſt place, he teaches, that a Prieſt, ſuppoſing he has made a good Confeſſion, has all the eſſential diſpoſitions, requir'd by the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> for the reception of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; that is to ſay, that he is in the ſtate of Grace: which, in ſpite of the imaginations of all our newfangled innovators, is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true. In the ſecond place, when <hi>Bauni</hi> ſayd, this opinion was ſafe in practice, (he who thought it in married perſons a venial ſin) he intended no more but that a Prieſt, or Curat, might, without ſin, follow this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the functions, joyn'd to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, did not abſolutly diſpenſe with him from ſaying Maſs, which ſometimes do's happen.</p>
                  <p>And in ſuch a circumſtance, a Country Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, for example, might poſſibly be, whoſe pariſhoners, if they loſt Maſs upon a Sunday, by his forbearing to ſay it, wou'd take up ſtrange ſuſpicions of him. Let a man upon this deciſion conſult, not our pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, whoſe miſtaken ſeverity has ſometimes caus'd, on ſuch like occaſions, a great deal of ſcandal, but any Divine of good ſenſe, who
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:174113:155"/>knows how to apply the moſt ſolid principles of Morals to particular accidents and caſes, and he will quickly find, whether he can think otherwiſe, upon this ſubject, than <hi>Bauni</hi> has done.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt, ſayd the Abbot, that this muſt be <hi>Baunis</hi> opinion, after what he has ſayd of married perſons. But theſe favorable, and ſo well grounded expoſitions, are not to be made by the Jeſuits: one part of a book is not enuff, to defend the other, and upon every deciſion in Morals, their Divines ought to have repeated all their principles, reſtrictions and circumſtances, and prevented all manner of difficulties and objections. If they fail to do that, their adverſaries wou'd be ſure to make extracts of their books, and get theſe extracts cenſur'd, and afterwards publiſh'd, with beat of drum, or ſound of trumpet, all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> that the Jeſuits doctrin had been condem'd. But is this all you have to ſay upon this place?</p>
                  <p>Yes, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> for as to what <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made his Jeſuit ſpeak, touching the preference the Divines of the Society give the Caſuiſts, before the Fathers, and ſuch other trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we have already ſayd enuff. It is true, anſwer'd the Abbot, but yet do you not look upon what he has advanc'd, in general, againſt the Jeſuit <hi>Filliucius,</hi> as a calumny, to wit, that the laws of the Church, by being no longer obſerv'd do loſe their force and vertue, <hi>cum jam deſuetudine abierunt?</hi> this propoſition, ſo
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:174113:155"/>expreſs'd, may be a falſe and dangerous maxim; whereas, in the inſtance <hi>Filliucius</hi> makes uſe on't, and whence <hi>Paſcal</hi> has drawn it, it is the moſt reaſonable in the world. I have really ſeen, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> abundance of people very much ſcandaliz'd at this propoſition, taken in the ſenſe <hi>Paſcal</hi> has given it.</p>
                  <p>This maxim, anſwer'd the Abbot, is of uſe in the Civil and the Canon law. Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> Saint <hi>Antonin, Gerſon,</hi> and others, as well Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as Lawyers, do very often make uſe on't: and the very terms of <hi>Filliucius,</hi> are taken out of the law. But the application of it, may be, either, good, or bad: let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee, how it is applied by <hi>Filliucius.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Paſcal's</hi> quotation, you will find it in the ſecond tome treatiſe 25. <hi>nu.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>They read it, and ſaw, that <hi>Filliucius</hi> do's, there, treat of the puniſhments, decreed againſt blaſphemers, in the old Teſtament by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or, in the new, by Councels and Decrees of Popes. Whereupon he ſays, that the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in their Confeſſionals, ought to enjoyne thoſe penalties if they had been ſtill in uſe. But that ſome were never receiv'd in the Church, and others were become abſolete: <hi>At vel receptae nunquam ſunt, vel jam deſuetudine abierunt.</hi> Is any thing more true, than this matter of fact? and was this maxim ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd more properly? this notwithſtanding is the place <hi>Paſcal</hi> makes uſe of, to prove, that the Jeſuits laugh at the ancient diſcipline; and make all it's rules give place, to the frivolous maxims of their Caſuiſts.</p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:174113:156"/>
                  <p>That which follows, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> is a part of my task: but I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that my courage fail'd me, and I grew weary. You'l eaſily believe, that the comparing and confronting of texts and citations, cou'd not be a very agreeable entertainment for a man of my humor. I was no longer able to endure ſo toilſome and unpleaſant a work; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reſolv'd to refer my ſelf for the reſt, to the teſtimony and integrity of Mr. Abbot.</p>
                  <p>What, reply'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> laughing, do you give ground or fall back? this is not very fair nor ſtout. But I am very glad, I have gotten, over you, the advantage of perſeverance; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I cannot but frankly own, that, like you, I have already had ſtrong temptations on this ſubject, and cou'd not have anſwer'd, much longer, for my own patience. For, whatever pleaſure I take, in ſeeing Mr. Abbot clear and unfold ſo neatly, as he do's, theſe things, in the intangling and perplexing whereof, all <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal's</hi> wit and cunning conſiſted; the matter is ſtill very knotty and obſcure, and obliges me to too much ſtudy and application.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the little we have ſeen, is more than enuff, to guide us in the judgment we ought to make of the Provincial Letters. <hi>Perrault's</hi> panegyric of them, cannot be more clearly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi'd, than it has been by Mr. Abbot; I am above all things for <hi>The ſolidity of his arguments, and for his raillerys always pure and decent.</hi> The Jeſuits have no cauſe to complain; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more ſolidly prov'd, by any perſon,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:174113:156"/>who contains himſelf within the bounds of good manners, that their Society is the plague of the Church, a body of wicked and extravagant ſots and mad-men, that ought to be baniſh'd out of the Common-wealth, or ſhut up in <hi>Bedlam.</hi> It is not to detract, ſlander, calumniate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or falſify, when all this is done with <hi>Paſcals</hi> wit and pleaſantry.</p>
                  <p>Raillery a part, we are indeed infinitly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to you, continu'd he, ſpeaking to the Abbot, and we pray you, not to give your ſelf any farther trouble, to prove to us, that <hi>Paſcal,</hi> and thoſe who furniſh'd him with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs againſt the Jeſuits, ſtood much more in need, than theſe Fathers did, of an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make their Morals more ſtrict and ſevere. He, that has given occaſion for this maſter-piece of calumny, and who daily ſtudys to improve it, wou'd edify all true Catholics by recanting, or diſclaiming it. This recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wou'd certainly be neceſſary to diſcharge his conſcience of a world of things, for which his great age cannot but advertiſe him, he muſt, very ſoon, give a terrible account to God.</p>
                  <p>Oho, anſwers the Abbot! you are well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd indeed to preach to Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> and endeavor to fill his head with ſcruples. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, he has no more to do, but to dy; the pieces for his Canoniſation are already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd. And of this you cannot doubt, if you do but reflect, upon the veneration paid by his Party, to the memory of the Abbot of <hi>Saint Cyran.</hi> Notwithſtanding the authentic teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:174113:157"/>of Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> founder of Saint <hi>Lazar,</hi> which they have retrench'd out of the laſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the life of this holy man (for that faction gains their point in all their undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) but which Gods Providence has ſtill preſerv'd elſewhere. Notwithſtanding the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Abbot of <hi>Priéres,</hi> of the then Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens Bellegarde,</hi> and which is more, of the late M. <hi>Caulet,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> a witneſs very troubleſom to <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> notwithſtanding what F. <hi>Gondren,</hi> General of the Oratorians both ſayd and knew, and ſeveral other witneſſes of untainted reputations, of the pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which this Abbot had contriv'd, and was carrying on againſt the Church, and of his heretical and extravagant opinions; in ſpite of all this, I ſay, the Abbot of <hi>Saint Cyran</hi> muſt paſs for a Saint, if what is daily ſayd by the Party, was to be believ'd, and for a great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, unjuſtly perſecuted by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who look'd upon him as another <hi>Luther;</hi> judge by this, what will be ſayd of Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> whoſe zeal had quite another kind of ſucceſs, than that of Mr. <hi>Saint Cyran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But infine, continu'd the Abbot, you quit me at too eaſy and too cheap a rate; I had a mind we ſhou'd have carryed on our work, at leaſt, to the tenth Letter; for thoſe which follow are little more, than replications and frequent repetitions of the ſame ſort of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures. But in this you ſhall command; I, for my part, can only offer you, which I freely do,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:174113:157"/>to proceed, or continue what we have begun, when ever you pleaſe I will tell you more. I have in my head a ſmall deſign, and which is pleaſant enuff, of drawing up a ſcheme of the ſpeculative and practical Morals of the Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; a deſign, that cou'd very eaſily be put in execution: I ſhou'd have no occaſion to ſend to the <hi>Indies,</hi> or have recourſe to memoirs, brought five or ſix thouſand leagues. No no, I wou'd conſine my ſelf within the bounds of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> where moſt of the pieces I ſhou'd have need of, are certainly to be found: I wou'd follow the order of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Riſe and Origin of theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and diſputes, and bringing it down to our own days; the books, and Original pieces of the proceſs againſt the Abbot of <hi>Saint Cyran,</hi> wou'd, among other things, furniſh me with a great deal of matter. And I know a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand little ſtories, of ſeveral, that have, and ſtill make, a figure among the party, which wou'd give me occaſion enuff, to make the ſubject both pleaſant and diverting. The ſingle proceſs of <hi>Perrette</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnauld's</hi> ſhe penitent, and by him ſupported againſt the Dean of <hi>Senlis,</hi> this Devotes Uncle, and Gardian. This ſuit alone, I ſay, well told, with all it's circumſtances, wou'd, I can aſſure you, make a ſmall tome that wou'd not tire the readers.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Abbot, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> you muſt needs go on with this deſign; it wou'd, without doubt, be very ſucceſsful: but do you know,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:174113:158"/>that I have taken the pains to write down our former diſcourſes; that we have communicated them to ſome of our friends; that they already run about <hi>Paris;</hi> and that I am reſolv'd to take the ſame courſe for the remainder?</p>
                  <p>I am of a meek, peaceful ſpirit and temper, anſwer'd the Abbot, and wou'd not willingly be an aggreſſor: but ſince you bring me into play by publiſhing our diſcourſes, you may very likely expoſe me to be libell'd by the Janſeniſts: which may perhaps put me alſo, into the ſame humor, and make me, at leaſt, endeavor an equal return. As for the reſt, how tireſom ſoever, you may find the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Provincial Letters, you muſt, notwithſtanding, grant me upon this point two favors.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that you may have ſomething in this matter perfect, at leaſt, in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, you muſt give your ſelf the trouble of reading two, or three ſmall, looſe, ſheets of paper, concerning ſeveral general topics, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in the Provincial Letters; and which, together with the doctrin of probability, make, according to <hi>Paſcal,</hi> the whole fund of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Policy and Morals; that is to ſay, the direction of intention, the diſtinction of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in ſpeculation, and probable in practiſe; equivocations and mental reſervations. You need not trouble your ſelf with inquiries after the author; you will, in a few words, ſee in them all that is good or bad, as to theſe points of doctrin; and whether the Jeſuits are blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:174113:158"/>excuſable, or commendable, for what they have writ and taught upon this ſubject: the reading of the whole, will not take up an hour of your time; and yet you will find it ſufficiently inſtructive in this matter; whereof the greateſt part of men, have little or no knowledge, but very ſlight and ſuperficial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The caſes made uſe of for examples, are drawn out of the ſeventh and eighth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters, and the others following, which you wou'd not take the pains to examin.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing I ask of you, is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt article of the laſt Letter of ten addreſſes to <hi>Paſcals</hi> friend in the country, which he calls <hi>The Myſtery of iniquity compleated:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it relates to the love of God, <hi>which,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, the Jeſuits ſay <hi>is not neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> We muſt, if you pleaſe, meet one of theſe days in your Janſeniſts friends library about this article, and then I hope to make amends for the occaſion you lately loſt of ſeeing us two engag'd in the diſcuſſions of much leſs important matters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> anſwer'd, that it wou'd be a ſenſible pleaſure to them, to ſee the papers he mention'd, and that for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Janſeniſt, they wou'd take any time he ſhou'd think fit to appoint.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>doxus</hi> coming to the Abbot's houſe, and finding <hi>Cleander</hi> already arriv'd, ſayd to him, we ſhall not fail, to day, of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our man. He had notice of our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and is now actually waiting for us in his library. Let us take coach then, anſwer'd the Abbot; I am ready, only give me leave to take two or three papers, of which, I foreſee we may have need. But yet before I go, I pray let me know what kind of man is he I am to deal with: I cannot for my life under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why you ſhou'd be ſo very ſhy, as hitherto you have been, to tell me the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of an adverſary, with whom you have ſo often threaten'd me.</p>
               <p>What need you trouble your ſelf, replied <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> laughing; have I not ſayd enuff of him already, in telling you he is a Janſeniſt? however, ſince you are ſo deſirous of being more fully inform'd of his character, it's fit you ſhou'd be ſatisfi'd. But yet, ſince he is one of my friends, 'tis poſſible, you may not think my account of him ſo fit to be believ'd; and therefore <hi>Cleander,</hi> who has ſeen him often with me and knows him well enuff, may ſpeak of him more diſintereſtly, and with greater freedom.</p>
               <p>He is an admirable man, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> and a perfect original. He has a great quickneſs of fancy, and an extraordinary readineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:174113:159"/>himſelf; which is to ſupply his want of wit, and he is ſo very wiſe, as ſeriouſly to value himſelf upon being a Janſeniſt: and looſes no oportunity to make all men believe he is what he is; for he thinks to get, by this means, the title of a great wit. He has been but two years at <hi>Paris;</hi> he was before the chief Magiſtrat of the ſmall town of....., du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, he had frequent correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance by letters, with Mr...... and Mr...... for whoſe intereſt and ſervice, he made himſelf buſineſs enuff; and they were overjoy'd, for having found in that country, an emiſſary of his credit and reputation. They have, for a long time, look'd upon him, as one of their forlorn hope; and I my ſelf have often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd him to a fireſhip; for the loſs of which men are not much concern'd, provided it do's but firſt do execution and blow up ſome of the enemies great ſhips. <hi>Eudoxus</hi> has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him ſeveral years, and I have known him ever ſince his coming to <hi>Paris.</hi> If his anſwers do not altogether ſatisfy you, his manner of making them will, at leaſt, divert you.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, anſwer'd the Abbot, that you have as great an expectation to be made merry, as you have to be inſtructed. But without more words, they took coach and drove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Timante's</hi> lodging: this is the name, by which this new antagoniſt of the Abbot's is to paſs. <hi>Eudoxus</hi> went ſtrait up to the library, where he found him: and having ſaluted him,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:174113:160"/>told him he had brought the Abbot with him, of whom he had ſpoken the day before. He is, ſayd he, an obſtinat, head-ſtrong, Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt; who has lately reſolv'd, to undertake the defence of the Jeſuits againſt the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Letters. I'le put him into your hands to deal with; and having conquer'd him, make him, I pray, ſubmit, and do honor to the great Saint <hi>Austin</hi> and the honeſt party.</p>
               <p>You have had the experience, more than once, anſwer'd <hi>Timante,</hi> that upon this ſubject, I am never taken unprovided. Give me but an adverſary worth the trouble, and you ſhall find I will give you a good account of him. Without more a do, they went immediatly down to <hi>Cleander</hi> and the Abbot. I will very gladly, ſayd <hi>Timante</hi> to them, make one in the diſcourſes <hi>Eudoxus</hi> tells me, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun upon the Provincial Letters: you are a Moliniſt, continu'd he, addreſſing himſelf to the Abbot; and I declare to you, that I my ſelf am a Janſeniſt; and ready to maintain the truth of theſe admirable Letters, as I wou'd that of the Goſpel. For there is nothing in them, but pure truth, without any mixture of error, lyes, or miſtake.</p>
               <p>I have a long time known, anſwer'd the Abbot, that the guift of infallibility has been allow'd Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> by his party; but I did not know, till now, that they granted the ſame privilege to <hi>Paſcal.</hi> As for my ſelf, I do not take upon me to defend the Jeſuits doctrin in ſo univerſal a manner: I conſider they are
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:174113:160"/>like other men, and believe them capable of being ſometimes miſtaken. But, however the matter ſtands as to other points, concerning which, <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> may ſome other time tell you their opinions, we are now come hither, but to inform our ſelves, by the help of your great library, of one ſingle point. The matter is, to know whether, what <hi>Paſcal</hi> has reproach'd the Jeſuits with, touching the precept of the love of God, be true or falſe.</p>
               <p>Ho! truly ſayd <hi>Timante,</hi> this is a doubt quite out of faſhion; and I admire <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> cou'd have patience to hear you upon this ſubject. I know not, anſwer'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> whether Mr. Abbot has the art to remove, or to make charms; but which ſoever of theſe is his talent, it is certain, he has given us a very different impreſſion, from what we had before of <hi>Paſcal.</hi> He has ſhewn us the Jeſuits books, and, in them, has often made us read the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary of what this writer pretends to have found; and I cou'd almoſt be tempted to believe, he had done the ſame things by theſe books, which ſome ſay, the Jeſuits did with that of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> after the condemnation of the five propoſitions, which, being ſhewn in this book, to ſome perſons, and they not thinking it poſſible, Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> cou'd have been guilty of a ly, when he affirm'd he never ſaw them in it, ſayd theſe Fathers had falſifi'd <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> and inſerted in him the condem'd propoſitions, which they were ſure cou'd not be in the original edition; to which Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld's</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:174113:161"/>affirmation related. I ſhou'd have thought as much, I ſay, concerning <hi>Bauni, Valentia, Vaſquez,</hi> and ſeveral others, if the copys we made uſe of, had not, for the moſt part, come out of your library; where I am confident, you have none but good editions.</p>
               <p>A man muſt really ſuffer himſelf to be charm'd, anſwer'd <hi>Timante,</hi> to take up ſuch extraordinary ſentiments as thoſe you ſeem to be poſſeſs'd with. What, do's not Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſpeak truth in the Provincial Letters? where he quotes, not only, the books, but the very chapters, pages, and numbers; and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even the ſeveral editions? and are not the Jeſuits the patrons of looſe Morals? I dare you to ſay otherwiſe in <hi>Paris;</hi> unleſs you ſay it, before certain people, who are frited out of their little wits with the bugbear of Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme: and yet among them, you will find ſome, who in the point now in debate, will not ſtick to declare themſelves Janſeniſts; and who will ſubſcribe, without heſitation to all the Letters, except the three firſt, wherein the author raillies about ſufficient grace, the <hi>potentia proxima,</hi> and the aſſemblys of <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us quit the general theſis, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him; and let every man think, or be of what opinion he pleaſes; let us come to the point, that brought us hither: are you not much edifi'd, continu'd he, to ſee how we intereſt our ſelves about the love of God? what do you maintain upon this article for <hi>Paſcal</hi> againſt the Jeſuits?</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:174113:161"/>
               <p>I am ready to maintain, ſayd <hi>Timante,</hi>

                  <hi>Paſcals</hi> propoſition in all it's latitude, that <hi>The Jeſuits teach, that the love of God is not neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> And what will you do, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> to the Abbot?</p>
               <p>I will maintain, anſwer'd he, and am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to prove it, that the Jeſuits do teach the direct contrary, to what in <hi>Paſcals</hi> words this Gentleman has affirm'd. It is indeed your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prove it, replied <hi>Cleander. Timante</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the matter of fact, and you affirm it, ſhew us therefore how it ſtands in the Jeſuits books.</p>
               <p>We ſhou'd for a long time find employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſayd the Abbot, if we ſhou'd read, one after another, all the writers of the Society, who in expreſs terms ſay, that the love of God, is neceſſary to Salvation. I ſpeak not of the books of Meditations, Spiritual Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Chriſtian Practices, and an infinity of other works of Devotion; wherein the Jeſuits Preach up nothing ſo much, as the love of God. I paſs by their <hi>Rodriguez's,</hi> the <hi>Saint-Jure's,</hi> the <hi>Hayneuve's,</hi> the <hi>Suffren's,</hi> the <hi>Du Pont's,</hi> and a thouſand others, whoſe books you can no ſooner open, than find this truth in them. But I will confine my ſelf to their Divines, whoſe names wou'd make too long a liſt. You may however ſee it, in a book Printed at <hi>Louvain</hi> in 1689, intitled <hi>Sexaginta quinque propoſitiones nuper à Sanctiſſimo Domino noſtro</hi> Innocentio <hi>XI proſcriptae, à Societatis Jeſu Theologis diu ante Sanctiſſimi Domini decretum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu communiſſimo rejectae.</hi> Where there are no
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:174113:162"/>leſs, than thirty cited. Will you be content with nine or ten, ſuch as are the chief, and look'd upon as the Oracles of the Order?</p>
               <p>I'le quit you for one half, anſwer'd <hi>Timante,</hi> in a bold and Magiſterial tone. Abate Mr. Abbot nothing, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> and be not too forward; for I have found, by experience, that he is very exact in his quotations. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſayd the Abbot, with Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Take the pains, I pray you, to reach me down his fourth tome. Liſten to theſe his words. <q>The holy Scripture do's not only ſay,
<note place="margin">L. 6. de gr. &amp; lib. arbitr. cap. 7.</note> that charity is the guift of God, but farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to love God: it do's not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us only to conſerve the infus'd habit of charity, but alſo obliges us, to love God with all our heart: for the laws have for object, the acts of the vertues they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and not the habits.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Abbot alſo read in Cardinal <hi>Lugo's</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Penance,
<note place="margin">Diſp. 7. ſect. 12. n. 250.</note> theſe words. <q>The command of loving God, is abſolutly founded upon the law of nature; and althô there had been for it, no poſitive law from God, yet ſhou'd we be oblig'd to it, as all Divines do agree.</q> You here quote Cardinals, anſwer'd <hi>Timante,</hi> that is to ſay, men, who in quitting the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys habit, quitted alſo their wicked maxims.</p>
               <p>You do not know, replied the Abbot, nor are you oblig'd to know ſo exactly, the chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of all the Jeſuits books: <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Lugo</hi> were ſtill Jeſuits, when they wrote thoſe I have cited; and when the laſt ſayd, all
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:174113:162"/>Divines were agreed about this precept, he comprehended, without doubt, in this general propoſition all of his own Society, at leaſt, as much as others. But ſince, continu'd he, you will have no Cardinal Jeſuits, I will paſs <hi>Tolet,</hi> whoſe teſtimony I was about to allege, and only ſtick to thoſe, who were but Jeſuits. I ſee on your ſhelf of Divines, the tome of <hi>Suarez,</hi> wherein he treats of the three Theological ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: The Abbot open'd the book, and in his treatiſe of charity, read theſe following words.
<note place="margin">Diſ. 6. ſect. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, I ſay, that this precept concerns all men, and this is evident from the ſixth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Deuteronomy, You ſhall love your Lord your God with all your heart,</hi> &amp;c. and by the tenth of Saint <hi>Mathew, This command of loving God, is the firſt and greateſt command of all..</hi>.. the reaſon of my concluſion is, that this love is a neceſſary means to Salvation, and that theſe kind of means have always the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a command.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> interrupting him, when <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſayd, that the Jeſuits taught the love of God was not neceſſary to Salvation, he ought to have excepted <hi>Suarez</hi> out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for it is impoſſible, for any man to ſpeak upon this ſubject, more clearly, than he has done in what we have read. <hi>Hujuſmodi dilectio eſt medium neceſſarium ad ſalutem.</hi> In the mean time, to judge by the eſteem this Divine is in, not only with the Society, but alſo with all others, whether if the Jeſuits had been oblig'd to determin, which of their Body they wou'd
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:174113:163"/>have paſs for the chief Divine, they muſt not have choſen this man. They have not, in reality, as I have been aſſur'd, any one, whoſe doctrin is more the doctrin of the Jeſuits, than this authors doctrin is; nor who is more generally follow'd.</p>
               <p>I will add to this, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> what was lately told me by one of my friends, who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd much in <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſhew the great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they have of this Divine in that country; where, he ſayd; the reputation of <hi>Suarez</hi> was ſo great, that in moſt Univerſities, he was quoted in their diſputes, and the Defendants, to whom his authority was urg'd, durſt not refute him, but were oblig'd to reconcile, whatever was out of him objected, with the doctrin of the Theſis: he alſo told me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing pleaſant enuff, that in many towns of <hi>Spain,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, even the Artificers, as well as other tradſmen, are divided into two factions; one <hi>Suariſts,</hi> the other <hi>Thomiſts;</hi> in ſo much, that in the public ſports and recreations, the men are choſen out of theſe two different partys; and that the acclamations were frequently heard at bowls, ſometimes, of the <hi>Suariſts</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> according to the various ſucceſs of the gameſters, all, ready to fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ears, the one party for <hi>praemotio phyſica,</hi> and the other for <hi>Scientia media.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timante,</hi> notwithſtanding the trouble he was in, on account of the paſſages cited by the Abbot, out of theſe three famous Jeſuits, cou'd
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:174113:163"/>not forbear laughing at this odd proceeding of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and wou'd willingly have carry'd this digreſſion farther; but the Abbot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly returning to the point, ſayd to him, you ſee by what <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> have ſpoken, that if the Jeſuits cou'd have thought themſelves honor'd in the Schools by the name or reputation of any one of their Doctors, as the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> do by that of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they wou'd on this ſcore have prefer'd <hi>Suarez</hi> to <hi>Molina.</hi> And, indeed, few Jeſuits do follow <hi>Molina,</hi> in compariſon of thoſe, who ſtick to the principles and opinions of <hi>Suarez, Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> and they are Moliniſts, but becauſe they maintain, and with reaſon, that the doctrin of <hi>Molina,</hi> is without error; wherein there is none to be found, without miſrepreſenting and disfiguring it, that they might have a handle and pretence to refute it with the greater advantage. But ſince you have given me the name of Moliniſt the very firſt moment I have the honor of ſeeing you, it is fit I ſhou'd make good and maintain my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with credit and reputation; and that I ſhou'd alſo demonſtrate to you, that if <hi>Molina</hi> be to be believ'd, <hi>Paſcal</hi> muſt have ſpoken falſly, when he aſſerted, that the Jeſuits taught, <hi>The love of God was not at all neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> I ſhall find, in leſs than a minut, the place I want: I have it, liſten therefore, I pray, to what this Jeſuit ſays.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>After this, the Abbot ſhew'd in <hi>Tanner,</hi> theſe words;
<note place="margin">Tom. 3. diſp 2. de ſpe &amp; charit. q. 4. dub. 4. n. 62.</note>
                  <q>The command which obliges us to love God, is like a firſt principle, known, and acknowleg'd by all the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He found in <hi>Valentia,</hi> this which follows. <q>When we inquire, how and when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of loving God do's oblige us, we do preſuppoſe, as a thing moſt certain, that there is ſuch a command. For this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both by Scripture and by reaſon.
<note place="margin">Tom. 3. diſp. 3. q. 19. pun. 1.</note> And a little lower, I ſay, in the firſt place, that we are oblig'd, by this command, to love God; not to love him with a common love, but as our laſt end, and by conſequence with a ſoverain love, preferring him above all things in the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Layman</hi> alſo ſpeaks, in this manner. <q>The precept of the love of God, is call'd in the 22th. of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> the firſt and greateſt command of all; becauſe it relates to the firſt act of the moſt excellent vertue, and the moſt neceſſary to Salvation.</q>

               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:174113:164"/>
               <p>See likewiſe, what <hi>Becanus's</hi> opinion is,
<note place="margin">De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. c. 35. q. 6. n. 4.</note> in this matter. <q>There is a twofold command of loving God, the firſt is general, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in all parts of the Decalogue, which obliges us to keep the law of God: the ſecond is poſitive and particular, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to make an act of charity, whether this act be produc'd by, or is the motion of our love to God, or a deteſtation of our ſin for offending God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Sanchez</hi> thus argues.
<note place="margin">In decal. l. 2. c. 35. n. 1.</note>
                  <q>Nothing is more certain, than that there is a command of loving God; the reaſon is, becauſe the act of loving God is neceſſary to Salvation; <hi>He that loves him not,</hi> ſayd Saint <hi>John, is dead already;</hi> but all that is neceſſary to Salvation, is commanded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Have you then a mind, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, and addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Timantes,</hi> that Mr. Abbot ſhou'd turn over, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all your library? there is no more room on your table for theſe <hi>folio's;</hi> have you not ſeen enuff to convince <hi>Paſcal,</hi> either of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or of lying? of lying, if he has, as he ought to have done, conſulted all theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; of raſhneſs, if he has advanc'd, upon the credit of an other, <hi>That the Jeſuits taught the love of God was not neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> Theſe are the moſt learned and moſt famous of all their Divines; and moſt of the others do but copy, or abridge, what they have written. What anſwer can you make to all theſe matters of fact?</p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:174113:165"/>
               <p>I anſwer, ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> equally troubl'd and ſurpris'd, by another enumeration made by <hi>Paſcal</hi> in the ſame place, according to which the Jeſuits of <hi>France</hi> are of a contrary opinion. Obſerve but the words of Mr. <hi>Paſcal's</hi> Jeſuit. <q>Thus our Fathers have freed men from the troubleſom obligation of actually loving God: and this doctrin, is ſo advantagious, that our Fathers <hi>Anat, Pintereau, le Moyne</hi> and <hi>A. Sirmond</hi> himſelf, defended it vigorouſly, when others had a mind to run it down.</q> It ſeems to me, added <hi>Timantes,</hi> that F. <hi>Sirmond</hi> alone, is to be valued full as much as <hi>Sanchez, Suarez,</hi> and <hi>Layman,</hi> and perhaps many more all joyn'd together.</p>
               <p>The Abbot, at theſe laſt words of <hi>Timantes,</hi> fell a laughing, what ſayd he to him, do you believe the Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> here ſpoken of, to be that famous Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> who, in ſpite of the Janſeniſts utmoſt envy and malice, preſerv'd ſo great a name and reputation among all the learned, not only of the Catholic Church, but alſo of all other ſects and partys whatſoever. He is not, at all, the perſon intended: your error nevertheleſs is very pardonable, ſince it is founded but upon <hi>Paſcal's</hi> malice.</p>
               <p>And, really, when after Father <hi>Anat,</hi> and Father <hi>le Moyne,</hi> men known, and, upon many accounts, very valuable, theſe words, <hi>and Father A. Sirmond himſelf,</hi> are ſeen to be added, by way of gradation, who wou'd not believe, but that this muſt be meant of the renowned Father <hi>Sirmond:</hi> he was the only one publicly known
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:174113:165"/>in the world, and known commonly, but by his ſurname. The preference, in point of merit and authority, which the word <hi>himſelf</hi> gives to the perſon here ſpoken of, above Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Anat,</hi> and Father <hi>le Movne,</hi> leaves no place to doubt, but that he muſt be the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Among two thouſand men, who ſhou'd read the Provincial Letters, there wou'd not be found ſix, that ſhou'd not believe the Society's reputation wounded by this reproach on one of their members, who is accounted the chief ornament of their whole body; and I do on this account, forgive your having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him, to <hi>Suarez, Sanchez, Layman</hi> and <hi>Molina:</hi> and alſo to the two Cardinals, <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and <hi>de Lugo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But really, the man <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſpeaks of, is a man very little known, and of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: however, it ſhall not ly at my door, if we examin not, what relates to him: for there wants a great deal to make the idea given of this Father <hi>Sirmond's</hi> doctrin, to be true: but firſt, let us ſee, whether Father <hi>Pintereau,</hi> Father <hi>Anat,</hi> and Father <hi>le Moyne,</hi> do vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defend it. For in this alſo, there is an equivocation, to ſay no worſe of it, as great, as in the name of <hi>Sirmond.</hi> Have you, ſayd the Abbot to <hi>Timantes,</hi> the Jeſuits apology againſt <hi>la Theologie Morale?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have, anſwer'd he, all that has been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on both ſides in this matter; but I do, notwithſtanding, own to you, that I have read very little of what the Jeſuits have writ in their
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:174113:166"/>own defence. They are too ſerious, and do not divert me as Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> do's; and beſides, all he ſays, has a certain air of truth, which is of it ſelf perſwaſive, and makes it unneceſſary to read all thoſe rapſodies, his adverſaries have heap'd up together, with deſign to refute him.</p>
               <p>This method of hearing but one ſide, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Abbot, laughing, is very wonderful, for the enabling men to make a right and equitable judgment between two contending parties. Which words he had no ſooner end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than he took into his hands the book at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Father <hi>Pintereau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. part. p. 52. &amp; 53.</note> intitled, <hi>Les impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures &amp; les ignorances du libelle intitulè la Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie Morale des Jeſuites: par l'Abbé du</hi> Boiſic. He read in it the paſſage cited by <hi>Paſcal;</hi> where the author do's but maintain theſe words of the Councel of <hi>Trent;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seſ. 14.2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>That Attrition, produc'd by the fear of hell, diſpoſes the ſinner to receive Grace in the Sacrament, althô, that, without the Sacrament, it is not ſufficient to juſtify him.</hi> There this Divine ſhews, that the opinion, which holds, that Attrition, with the Sacrament do's juſtify, is the doctrin of, almoſt, all Divines, eſpecially ſince the Councel of <hi>Trent;</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô theſe Divines do not treat the contrary opinion as hereſy, yet many of them do eſteem it very raſh; becauſe the words, of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel upon this ſubject, do appear ſo poſitive and expreſs; and which is more, he quotes a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> in the year 1638, which ſays the ſame thing; a man cannot ſee in all this text of Father <hi>Pintereau,</hi> one ſingle word, which
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:174113:166"/>ſhews the love of God is not neceſſary for Salvation. How then and by what rules of honeſty, durſt <hi>Paſcal</hi> place this Divine in the number of thoſe, who maintain the opinion he attributes to Father <hi>Sirmond, That the love of God, is not neceſſary to Salvation?</hi> Cannot one then defend, with Catholic Divines, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent's</hi> doctrin concerning Attrition, without being ſuſpected to deſtroy the precept of the love of God?</p>
               <p>He! do you no ſee, replied <hi>Timantes,</hi> that in the words quoted by Mr. <hi>Paſcal,</hi> your Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit treats the obligation of loving God, as a difficult and troubleſom thing?</p>
               <p>Nothing is to be chang'd in the terms, ſayd the Abbot; <hi>Paſcal</hi> thus ſets them down. <hi>It was therefore reaſonable he ſhou'd take away that troubleſom and difficult obligation man was under, by the law of rigor, of exerting an act of perfect Contrition, to be justifi'd, and that he ſhou'd inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Sacraments, which might ſupply it's defect, with the help of a more eaſy diſpoſition:</hi> if he has ſayd, that this obligation of a perfect Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was troubleſom and difficult, he has ſayd ſo, after an infinit number of Divines; and this is very true, in the ſenſe, wherein ſo many learned men have ſayd it. An act of perfect Contrition, which includes an act of the pure love of God, is the moſt heroic act of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vertue; and moſt directly oppoſit to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love; of which it ſtifles and excludes thoſe motions, which appear the moſt lawful. He there ſpeaks of a ſinner, who by that means
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:174113:167"/>was to quit his ſin, and make an effort to break his chains, and his will of iron, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it, which keeps him faſt bound: for this act a man needs one of the ſtrongeſt graces, that is in all the treaſures of God's mercy. Infine, this is an act ſo hard, and ſo contrary to corrupted nature, that the Divinity of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> allows it to very few men in the world; and it was partly upon the account of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of making on't, that they formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Communion, ſo many peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for whole years, and even at Eaſter, in ſpite of the commands of the Church.</p>
               <p>Who then can doubt, if this doctrin be true, that Attrition, with the Sacrament, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to juſtify a ſinner; but that it is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular favor, granted by the new Teſtament, to thoſe under the law of the Goſpel, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious effect of the blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhed for us, and apply'd to ſinners in the Sacrament of Penance; ſince it is an eaſy way of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, which they had not, who liv'd under the yoke of the old law. What occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is there then of crying out, as <hi>Paſcal</hi> do's immediatly after, <hi>O Father, you put a man out of all patience, and the things that you have ſayd to me cannot be heard without horror?</hi> This is follow'd with a whole Sermon full of new impoſtures and calumnies; and wherein ſeveral paſſages of Scripture, concerning the love of God, are abus'd, to give the bloodieſt wounds, that ever cou'd be given to brotherly love and Chriſtian charity.</p>

               <p>They made an end of reading what was in Father <hi>Pintereau</hi> upon this ſubject, and what related to it, in the Apologies of Father <hi>Anat,</hi> and Father <hi>le Moyne.</hi> Where the whole is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, not to maintain the opinion of Father <hi>Antony Sirmond,</hi> ſuch as is attributed to him, but to defend the man, by endeavoring to ſhew, that his accuſers had not underſtood his meaning aright, and that there was nothing worſe in his expreſſions, than in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of many other Catholic Doctors, againſt whom, they had never objected any thing.</p>

                     <hi>They have gone ſo far in impiety, as to maintain, that an interior act of the love of God, was but counſel'd and not commanded.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>All this is very true, anſwer'd the Abbot, but you ſee, <hi>Timantes</hi> is not ſo eaſily conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as you; he argues upon other principles, and I am going to ſatisfy him. Say rather, replied <hi>Timantes,</hi> that you are a going to wrangle and cavil with him.</p>
               <p>Not at all, ſayd the Abbot, my deſign is only to extricat and clear things a little. I have, more than once, obſerv'd, that one of <hi>Paſcals</hi> ſecrets, is to puzzle and confound mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that he poſſeſſes, in perfection, the art of magnifying objects, and that giving them afterwards to <hi>Wendrok,</hi> who is naturally, as is ſayd, very fanciful, he turns them into ſpecters, or bugbears, againſt which, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> like, he fights with all imaginable rage and fury; and with a heat and fire, which makes him, from time to time, commit very groſs ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes amidſt thoſe fine Latin phraſes, that made him paſs for the <hi>Cicero</hi> of the party, in the opinion of all thoſe, who underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Soleciſms in <hi>Wendrok,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Timantes</hi> in a fret; thoſe are the Jeſuits calumnies: there is
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:174113:168"/>better Latin, and more elegance in his notes and tranſlation, than there is in <hi>Petavius, Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Maffeus,</hi> and all their writers put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The diſpute, at preſent, is not of <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droks</hi> ſoleciſms, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> interrupting him, but certain it is, that Mr. Abbot ſhew'd me ſome lately, of which I had not taken notice, and which might, poſſibly, have eſcaped you alſo, as well as me: but let us put this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter off to another time. You muſt, Mr. Abbot, now ſatisfy, if you can, <hi>Timantes</hi> upon the point in hand.</p>
               <p>This indeed is my intention, anſwer'd the Abbot; let us therefore return to our ſubject, and read the paſſage in the tenth Letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he himſelf found theſe words. <q>I will paſs by all that fooling, where the wit of the man ſo inſolently ſports it ſelf with the love of God; but, purſu'd he, our Father <hi>Antony Sirmond,</hi> who triumphs upon this matter in his admirable book of the <hi>Deffenſe de la vertu,</hi> where he ſpeaks, as he tells his reader, French in <hi>France,</hi> diſcourſes thus in the 2d. <hi>to. ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 12.13.14. &amp;c. <hi>Saint</hi> Thomas <hi>ſays, that a man is oblig'd to love God, as ſoon as he comes to the uſe of reaſon: that's a little too ſoon:</hi> Scotus <hi>ſays, every Sunday: upon what is this founded? others hold, when one is grievouſly tempted, yes, in caſe there be no way but this to avoid the temptation.</hi> Sotus <hi>ſays, when one receives a benefit from God; good to thank him for't. Others ſay at the hour of death, that's late indeed. Nor do I believe, that this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:174113:169"/>ought to be done upon the reception of ſome Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Attrition with Confeſſion, if they have convenience of making on't, is ſufficient for that.</hi> Suarez <hi>ſays, that a man is oblig'd to it, ſome time or other; but at what time? he makes you your ſelf judge of that, for he himſelf knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; nor indeed do I; for who ſhou'd know what this Doctor did not?</hi> And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, at laſt, that a man in rigor, is not oblig'd to any thing, but to obſerve the other commands without any affection for God, and without giving him his heart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he do's not hate him. And this he proves at large in his ſecond treatiſe.</q> When the Abbot had read thus far, he ſayd to <hi>Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> you are Sir a Divine without doubt.</p>
               <p>No indeed Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Timantes,</hi> neither was Mr. <hi>Paſcal,</hi> but this did not hinder him, from arguing extreamly well upon all Moral matters; wherein a man needs but common ſenſe to make a right judgment. A man muſt have ſomething elſe beſides that, replied the Abbot, to judge well of ſome ſubjects; and I cannot upon this, give you the ſatisfaction I deſire, without entring a little into Divinity: bear with me I pray you but one moment, I ſhall not be long.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there never was a Divine, that abſolutely denied we had a precept of loving God, and that the obſervance of it was neceſſary to Salvation: but after the Doctors had, for the better clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, made a diſtinction in this matter of ſeveral kinds of precepts, they were divided upon ſome points.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:174113:169"/>
               <p n="2">2. This precept, they ſay, is, at once, both a general, and a particular precept; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible to fulfil, or obey it, in it's full extent, without the obſervation of all the other commands; of which we cannot vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a ſingle one, without wounding and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love which we owe to God. They account it a particular precept, becauſe it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns acts of a certain particular vertue, that is to ſay, acts of love, which, in their kind, are wholly different from the acts of the other vertues, by which we obſerve, or keep the reſt of the commands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The precept of charity, is, both nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and affirmative, a precept is call'd nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when it is conſider'd with reference to the things it prohibits to be done. 'Tis call'd affirmative, when it is conſider'd with reference to the things it commands to be done. Thus, the precept of the love of God, is negative, in as much as it forbids us to hate the ſupreme good; which is to be underſtood, not only, of a formal hatred, a ſin, of which, ſeldom any but the Devil is guilty, but alſo of every other ſin; becauſe that every ſin comprehends, or includes a diſtance and ſeparation from God. This precept is affirmative, in as much as it commands us, to make, on ſome occaſions, acts of the love of God: for example at the hour of death, or upon our firſt coming to uſe of reaſon, which repreſents God to us, as our ultimate end.</p>
               <p>The Divines farther teach, that a precept
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:174113:170"/>may oblige either, <hi>by it ſelf, by it's own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or by accident:</hi> their terms are <hi>per ſe</hi> and <hi>per accidens.</hi> It obliges by it ſelf, from the moment it enjoyns me, independently, and without reference to any other precept, to do an act of the particular vertue, to which it has a relation: thus the precept of charity, will oblige me by it ſelf, if, independently on all other precepts, it obliges me, to make acts of the love of God. A precept obliges by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, when I am bound to acquit my ſelf of ſome incumbent duty, or to reſiſt ſome temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that neither the one, nor the other, can be perform'd without doing the act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by this precept: thus finding my ſelf, in ſome circumſtance, oblig'd by the precept of repentance, to make an act of perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, the precept of charity, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, obliges me, by accident; becauſe that the act of Contrition, being a deteſtation of ſin, proceeding from the pure motive of the love of God, I cannot fulfil the precept of repentance, without making an act of the love of God.</p>
               <p>Infine, all Divines agree, that there is a precept or command to love God; that this precept is negative; becauſe it includes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of doing any thing againſt God; and that it is affirmative alſo; becauſe it obliges us to ſome particular duties. They likewiſe agree farther, that it is a general precept, extending it ſelf to the obſervation of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and that it is, alſo a ſpecial, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:174113:170"/>precept, obliging us, at leaſt, by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as in the caſe of the neceſſity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and ſome others. The whole current of Divines do, I ſay, agree in all theſe points; and Father <hi>Antony Sirmond</hi> alſo agrees with them in the treatiſe we are now upon. And it is not of this, he is accus'd, but in accuſing him of another thing, they conceal, or diſſemble his having taught, even this; which alone, if made known, wou'd have ſuffic'd to have leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd a great deal, the horror they endeavor'd to bring upon his whole doctrin. The ſingle queſtion then, that can here be put with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the doctrin of this Divine in particular, is to know, whether, ſuppoſing all theſe other obligations, wherein the whole world agrees, this precept, as far forth, as it is ſpecial, or particular, and affirmative, do's oblige us, not only by accident, but alſo by it ſelf, to make formal acts of love, by which we ſay to God, <hi>My God I love you with all my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that this author anſwers, that there is one command of God, by which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to have this love; which he calls <hi>affective,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> as there is likewiſe one, by which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to have this other love, which he calls <hi>effective,</hi> and the love of execution. Which, conſiſts in an exact obſervation of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but that the command of affective love, is a command of ſweetneſs, which God do's not give under pain of damnation, becauſe, ſayd he, a Father do's not ſay to his Children, <hi>Love me, or I will kill you.</hi> And that,
<note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> on the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:174113:171"/>contrary, the command of effective love, or of execution, is a rigorous command, becauſe if we do not fulfil it, we muſt go to hell.</p>
               <p>This is ſomewhat ſubtil, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him. A little too much, anſwer'd the Abbot, and if <hi>Timantes</hi> ſhou'd ſay but that, we ſhou'd ſoon agree. I ſay, replied <hi>Timantes,</hi> that this propoſition, is execrable and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and tends to the ſubverſion of all Morals, and the intire corruption of manners.</p>
               <p>Forbear a while, I beſeech you, anſwer'd the Abbot, your hyperbolies and exaggerations; ſuch things are good for nothing but to blind and dazzle men, who are not us'd to make reflexions. Let us look into things a little nearer. Do you believe, that it is this love <hi>affective,</hi> which troubles and confounds the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Chriſtians, and gives them pain in their way to heaven? no, truly, it is the love <hi>Sirmond</hi> calls <hi>effective;</hi> it is this exact fulfilling the commands of God, which diſcourages and overcomes nature. Let us, on the contrary, ſuppoſe, that there ſhou'd be no command at all, of affective love, but that the command of effective love ſhou'd ſubſiſt and be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; behold then the world reform'd; there wou'd be no more injuſtice, nor envy, nor jealouſy, nor diſſentions, nor impurities, nor debauches; ſince this reformation, the exerciſe of effective love, and the obſervation of the precept, which commands it, is but one and the ſame thing. Let this doctrin then of <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> be as falſe as you will; to ſay it tends
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:174113:171"/>to the relaxation and corruption of manners, is to give the world a very falſe allarm.</p>
               <p>Let us come a little cloſer to the matter, deſcend to particulars, and propoſe, according to the principles of <hi>Sirmond,</hi> this caſe. A man exactly obſerves all the commands of God, either out of that ſaving, pious, ſupernatural, fear, ſpoken of by the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and by it affirm'd, in oppoſition to <hi>Luther,</hi> to be a guift of the Holy Ghoſt, or out of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good motives of a different vertue from charity: a Chriſtian, for example, hears Maſs very devoutly on Sundays and Holy-days, and he hears it out of a motive of the vertue of Religion, which obliges him to honor him, whoſe infinit excellence and perfection merits the homage and adoration of all the creatures in the world: he communicates often, with this proſpect and conſideration, fully perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God is infinitly honor'd by this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of the victim which is offer'd in the holy Sacrifice. The ſame motive, hinders him from ſwearing, blaſpheming, and from being immodeſt in the Church. By a motive proportionable to this, he honors his Father and Mother, as perſons, who to him are in the place of God. He ſubmits himſelf intirely to his other Superiors, by the motive of the Obedience he ow's his Maker. He gives alms to the poor, by the motive of mercy: he faſts for Mortification, and in Obedience to the Church. In one word, ſometimes by one of theſe motives, and ſometimes by another, he
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:174113:172"/>avoids offending God; or if he do's offend him, he preſently returns again, and deteſts his ſin in the Sacrament of Penance, encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd by the motives of ſome one of theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues I have ſpoken of. By behaving himſelf in this manner, he obſerves the negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of charity, and fulfils the command of effective love.</p>
               <p>Now the queſtion propos'd by Father <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> is, to know, whether a man living in this manner, without any other formal act of the pure love of God, wou'd violate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of charity, and ſin mortally.</p>
               <p>This is not altogether the caſe, ſayd <hi>Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> interrupting him; you omit an eſſential circumſtance, remark'd by Mr. <hi>Paſcal,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you add ſuch a one, as hides the poyſon of this doctrin; it is, that <hi>Sirmond</hi> wou'd have it, that this man keeps the Commandments <hi>without any affection for God,</hi> and by conſequence obſerves the law, not as a Chriſtian, but as a Iew. Harken to what Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> ſayd he, at laſt concludes, that, in rigor, we are oblig'd to nothing more, than to the obſervation of the other Commandments, WITHOUT ANY AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECTION FOR GOD, and without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him our heart, provided we do not hate him. This is, what he proves at large, in his ſecond treatiſe.</q> Mind well, I pray ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> theſe words <hi>without any affection for God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have obſerv'd them very well, anſwer'd the Abbot, and have alſo, at the ſame time, taken
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:174113:172"/>notice, that they contain a moſt notorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture. Here's the book; I defy you, to ſhew me in it thoſe words. Read the 16.19.24. and 28 <hi>pages,</hi> quoted by <hi>Paſcal.</hi> If you find them there, I will own my ſelf the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor I have call'd him. Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> in this whole queſtion, where he oppoſes love <hi>affective</hi> to love <hi>effective,</hi> excludes nothing from effective love, but only the motive, or the ſole affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pure charity, by giving it the motive of ſome other vertue. His deſign, in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, is chiefly to examin this point, <hi>whether it be permitted, to act by hope, or fear, or any other motive, but the pure love of God;</hi> as he ſpeaks in his preface, and as it is impoſſible, for any one, not to ſee, that reads this treatiſe, either in whole, or in part. But to convince you, we need but hear how he explains himſelf in his deciſion of this queſtion.</p>
               <p>The Abbot in the 22th. <hi>page,</hi> read theſe words. <q>He, who do's not find himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with this Divine fire, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, keeps himſelf, out of ſome other good conſideration, ſo mindful of his duty, (obſerve, in your turn, ſayd the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, theſe words, <hi>out of ſome other good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi>) that he has no affection in his heart, thought in his mind, paſſion in his Soul, nor power in his perſon, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he do's not quit, to accompliſh, or fulfil, in all things, the main will of God. even in caſes, where he may be diſgrac'd, for governing himſelf as reaſon dictates, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:174113:173"/>He that is in ſuch a ſtate, obeys the rigor of this great Commandment, and do's that, which is neceſſary and ſufficient to Salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore falſe, purſued the Abbot, that this author is content, that Chriſtians ſhou'd obſerve, or keep the law as a Jew purely, in an exterior manner, without letting his heart have any ſhare in it; ſince he exacts, that it ſhou'd be done, by ſome, holy motive, and that it be ſtrong enuff, to make us in all things prefer God's intereſt to our own. For liften, I pray you, to what he farther adds. <q>So that we never put any thing in ballance with him, nor waver between his ſervice, and that of the creature, wilfully uncertain, to which of the two we ſhou'd give our ſelves up, much leſs, that we ſhou'd not prefer any thing to him, nor ſuffer our ſelves to act contrary to his will.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And well, ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> in turning the thing even as you ſay, and as you pretend, your <hi>Sirmond</hi> underſtood it, will you maintain this doctrin in all it's points?</p>
               <p>I do not ſay that, anſwer'd the Abbot; for I am, with the multitude of Jeſuits I have cited to you, of a contrary opinion; and believe, as they do, that the precept of charity do's, in rigor, oblige us to make, from time to time, formal acts, as they expreſs it, of the love of God, and diſtinguiſh'd from the acts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of fear, of religion, and of that love effective, whereof he ſpeaks. But, without
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:174113:173"/>defending the doctrin, a man ſometimes may, as I have already ſayd, defend the author, and therefore ſee, I pray, what, I believe, a man may yet ſay to juſtify him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is not the firſt Divine, that has ſpoke in this manner: have not you, ſayd he to <hi>Timantes,</hi> the book writ at <hi>Louvain,</hi> by Doctor <hi>Dubois,</hi> Royal Profeſſor of the holy Scripture in that Univerſity, concerning the propoſitions in Morals condem'd by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII in 1665 and 1666? Yes I have, anſwer'd <hi>Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and nothing is written in that country, upon ſuch kind of ſubjects, but is ſent me by ſome of my friends among the Doctors of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: look you here it is.</p>
               <p>This author, replied the Abbot, ſeems to be a ſincere man; he is not at all of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion you and I diſapprove;
<note place="margin">Art. 1.ad prop 1.</note> on the contrary he refutes it; but before he do's ſo, ſee how many authors he reckons to have taught it. Into which number he put <hi>Bannez</hi> a famous Divine of Saint <hi>Dominicks</hi> Order, Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> of the ſame Order, <hi>Marchantius, John Sanchez,</hi> who muſt not be miſtaken for the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit <hi>Sanchez, Janſenius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gant, Molanus</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Louvain,</hi> the greateſt part of theſe perſons wou'd have been, for their learning, quality, and characters, much more worthy adverſaries for <hi>Paſcal,</hi> than this good Father <hi>Antony Sirmond:</hi> but alas his buſineſs was to ſeek for adverſaries, only from among the Society.</p>
               <p>A certain perſon lately made me make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion which may be of ſome uſe to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits: it is, that the Janſeniſts cry Victory,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:174113:174"/>and believe themſelves ſecur'd againſt all their adverſaries attacks, and ſhelter'd againſt the Churches excommunications, if they can but diſcover ſome <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> whoſe expreſſions come near theirs upon the ſubject of Grace, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the contempt they have, at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, for the doctrin of this School: which they treat by the name of <hi>folly,</hi> when they ſpeak in confidence to one another, believing it, with their Maſter <hi>Janſenius,</hi> very diſtant from the thoughts, ideas, and ſyſtem of Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> Why, therefore, ſhou'd not a Jeſuit be freed from blame, or at leaſt excus'd, when he can produce, as may be done here for <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> famous Doctors, Cardinals and Biſhops, rais'd to theſe dignities, by the merits of their learning and their vertues? Another author, with whom I am not acquainted, who calls himſelf <hi>Florimond du Pleſſis,</hi> cites in favor of <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> the moſt eminent and illuſtrious of all the old Divines. Saint <hi>Antonin, Sylveſter, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> the learned <hi>Tostatus, Gerſon,</hi> and many others, whoſe expreſſions are perfectly like his.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, this Jeſuit had ſhewn no inclination for this opinion, but becauſe he believ'd it the opinion of Saint <hi>Thomas.</hi> Let us ſee, what he ſays <hi>pag.</hi> 15. <q>Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayd he, 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 44. <hi>a.</hi> 6. ſeems to anſwer not, and to content himſelf, for avoiding damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we ſhou'd not otherwiſe do any thing againſt ſacred love.</q> 
                  <hi>Wendrok,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Timantes,</hi> has fully ſhewn, how much <hi>Sirmond</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:174113:174"/>was miſtaken in attributing this doctrin to Saint <hi>Thomas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very hard, replied the Abbot, for any man to argue more in the air, to ſhoot at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or wider from the mark, than <hi>Wendrok</hi> has done about this article, in his long diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Whoever rightly underſtands the ſtate of the queſtion, and the Divines doctrin, which I have endeavor'd to explicat and unfold upon the command of charity, will ſee, that almoſt all <hi>Wendrok</hi> quotes out of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> againſt Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> may, by this Divine be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without any danger, and do's not at all prove, that Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> thoughts were any way different from his. But this is not the queſtion now in debate, whether this author be, or be not miſtaken, concerning the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this holy Doctor, or whether <hi>Wendrok</hi> has reaſon'd well, or ill upon the point: it may be always, truly, ſayd, that Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> opinion, well or ill underſtood, was Father <hi>Sirmond's</hi> rule: and it is alſo moſt certain, that Saint <hi>Thomas's</hi> way of expreſſing himſelf, gave him the occaſion of thinking as he did. Let us ſee, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> in Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, by which he ſupports himſelf; we ſhall eaſily judge by that, whether his miſtake be excuſable, or not.</p>
               <p>The place cited by <hi>Sirmond,</hi> was immediatly open'd; the Angelical Doctor there puts the queſtion;

                  <q>Whether a man in this life can fulfil the precept of the love of God;</q> and among other difficulties which he raiſes in this
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:174113:175"/>matter, he makes this objection; <q>Whoever do's not fulfil a precept, ſins mortally;</q> if then in this life no man can fulfil this precept, no body can be without mortal ſin. After he had explain'd in what ſenſe a man might, and in what ſenſe he might not, in this life, fulfil this precept, he thus anſwers the objection: <q>It muſt be ſayd, that as a Soldier, is not to be blam'd for not getting the victory, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he fights valiantly, in like manner he, who in this life do's not fulfil this precept, do's not ſin mortally, provided he do's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt Divine love.</q> 
                  <hi>Ita etiam qui in via hoc praeceptum non implet, nihil contra divinam dilectionem agens, non peccat mortaliter.</hi> This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> might have deceiv'd any other, as well as Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> ſuppoſing he be deceiv'd.</p>
               <p>After all, anſwer'd the Abbot, I believe he did not rightly underſtand Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in this place: but the manner alone, wherein this good Father concludes the queſtion, wou'd deſerve his pardon, althô he ſhou'd have been the firſt author of this opinion; which before him, ſo many others held. See how he ends this article. <q>It is our duty,
<note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> not to abuſe his fatherly goodneſs, but to act as much and as ſoon as poſſible by a principle of love, of diſintereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed love, of filial and of cordial love: for this is to be carefully heeded, that, althô God, of his great goodneſs may ſave us, by the paternal conduct of fear alone, by which he diſpoſes us, to receive the effect of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:174113:175"/>nevertheleſs, as this way is the leaſt pleaſing to him, ſo is it alſo, neither frequent, nor laſting, and we are eaſily turn'd from it ...... God has ſayd, <hi>He, who has my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and keeps them, is he that loveth me.</hi> He loves me by his works: to this he is in rigor oblig'd by my law: but alſo, adds he, he who do's not love me, do's not keep my ſayings; no truly he do's not keep them long: for which reaſon, the great Saint <hi>Antony</hi> ſayd, there was no ſure defence againſt the attacks of the Devil, but the love of Jeſus Chriſt: all others, are tranſitory and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</q> Is to ſpeak in this manner, added the Abbot, the way to ruin and deſtroy the love of God in the hearts of Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>As for my own part, ſayd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> I am mercifully inclin'd, and clearly of opinion, that if there ſhou'd, ever be a new edition of <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drok,</hi> the title of his third note, ought to be chang'd, <hi>Antonij Sirmondi adverſus hoc praeceptum intolerandi errores proponuntur.</hi> It is enuff to call it a miſtake, a vain Theological refinement, and as Mr. Abbot was willing to term it, a falſe ſubtilty, impertinently inſerted in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual treatiſe. <hi>Sirmond,</hi> without it, might very well have maintain'd, as he has done, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> againſt thoſe who had the confidence to teach, that every action, which has not the pure love of God for the motive, is a ſin.</p>
               <p>I will not go back, anſwer'd the Abbot, from what I ſayd, to make you hope, I might capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:174113:176"/>after I had for ſome time defended my ſelf; I think I have done this well enuff, and I am ready yet to add, even ſomewhat more, provided <hi>Timantes</hi> wou'd, on his ſide, uſe the ſame kind of freedom. We muſt ſee, ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> what new propoſitions you have to make, to induce me to this capitulation.</p>
               <p>I will own, continu'd the Abbot, that <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's</hi> diſtinction of <hi>The Commandment of rigor,</hi> for the love effective, and <hi>The Commandment of ſweetneſs,</hi> for love affective, is a little chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Who ſpeaks in this matter of a command, ſpeaks of a thing oppos'd to counſel, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and by conſequence, of a command of rigor. I will alſo ſay, that this doctrin, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the text, where it is very much ſoften'd, has in it ſelf ſomething very hard, and fit to be rejected, and that the pretended authority of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> or of <hi>Cajetan, Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> of <hi>Gant,</hi> or others, ought not to make it current.</p>
               <p>This is ſomething, ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> but what wou'd you have me grant you in exchange? I only ask, anſwer'd the Abbot, that the Divines of the Society, of whom you have heard me cite a great number of the moſt conſiderable, having all thought, and ſpoken quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently from Father <hi>Antony Sirmond,</hi> you wou'd not, for the future, ſay <hi>The Jeſuits teach, that the love of God is not neceſſary to Salvation:</hi> nor call that, the doctrin of the Society.</p>
               <p>This is, anſwer'd <hi>Timantes,</hi> a large article, and of great importance, which I cannot grant,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:174113:176"/>without firſt conſulting with the Gentlemen, who ſpeak ſo every day; and whom I value too much, not to continue to talk as they do.</p>
               <p>Since you will not then, replied the Abbot, conclude any thing, without theſe Gentlemen's conſent; it is fit, when you conſult them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point, to tell them, that a world of men are ſcandaliz'd at the doctrin, and falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of <hi>Paſcal</hi> in his tenth Letter; where pretending to attack the doctrin of the Jeſuits, or rather of the moſt celebrated Divines upon Attrition, he do's, not only, propound it, in ſuch a manner, as that it is not to be known by theſe Fathers, but that it is alſo eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that under this pretext, he wou'd fain run down ſome points, decided by the Councel; that this propoſition <hi>Attrition with the Sacrament is ſufficient,</hi> and this, <hi>The act of the love of God is not neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> have no relation to one another, as he wou'd have it to be underſtood: that the Jeſuits, defending the firſt, after an infinit number of Divines as conformable to the doctrin of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> do, at the ſame time, fight againſt the ſecond; that the one ought not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawn into conſequence, for the other; not even in any particular caſe, which ſome may think ought to be excepted, out of the general theſis; that they will ſhew them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and very good reaſon, when they deſire it, for the diverſity of the Divines ſyſtems, touching the time, wherein a man is oblig'd to make an interior, formal act of the love of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:174113:177"/>God; but on condition, theſe Gentlemen will, alſo, propoſe their hypotheſis, and opinion upon this matter; to the end it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd by the rules and principles of true and ſolid Divinity .........</p>
               <p>You are there cutting out a great deal of work for <hi>Timantes,</hi> ſayd <hi>Eudoxus</hi> interrupting him; let us I pray you leave all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſpeak of an accommodation, but of an intire, univerſal accommodation. I have a propoſition to make, which, at firſt, will be ſurpriſing to you; but you ſhall hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. It is to unite us four in the ſame party, and the ſame intereſts. Mr. Abbot has been hitherto devoted to the Jeſuits; you <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,</hi> to the Janſeniſts; <hi>Cleander</hi> and I have always kept a kind of neutrality; it is not fit to ſee, ſuch friends as we are, thus divided; to what ever ſide we turn, we ſhall be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; the Jeſuits wou'd eſteem themſelves happy in a friend, and a defender, ſo zealous, ſo quick, and ſo reſolute as <hi>Timantes:</hi> and if Mr. Abbot wou'd become a Janſeniſt, his converſion wou'd, no doubt, make the party great gainers.</p>
               <p>What you propoſe, is a matter of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> interrupting him; let us hear what are the conditions. The conditions, anſwer'd <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> have nothing in them, but what is juſt and reaſonable; you that are ſo equitable, will accept them without boggling; and I am alſo confident, that neither Mr. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, nor <hi>Cleander</hi> will reject them. It is not,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:174113:177"/>to make a diſcuſſion of the juſtice, or injuſtice of both partys, nor to enter into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of all the points of doctrin diſputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Let us lay aſide all prejudices, by which each party endeavors to gain an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the other, and only mind one thing, to wit, the advantage of ſincerity and fidelity.</p>
               <p>This I agree to, very willingly, ſayd <hi>Timantes;</hi> you know I pretend to thoſe vertues more than any man living; and you take me on my blind or weak ſide; but this point is of large extent, and the Jeſuits will have need of a great many apologies, before I can be drawn to 'um by this way. I intend, replied <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the matter to one ſingle point, wherein you are fully inſtructed, and which you need but juſt run over agen. To what point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Timantes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the very Provincial Letters, anſwer'd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus;</hi> do but only juſtify the fidelity and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of your Gentlemen in the fourth, fifth, ſixth and ſeventh Letters, of which we have already begun to have ſome doubts and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and <hi>Cleander</hi> and I are yours.</p>
               <p>This is a ſmall thing, a very eaſy buſineſs, ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> but I wou'd be glad that Mr. Abbot wou'd, alſo ſign the treaty on theſe terms. I do engage to make my ſelf a party to it, anſwer'd the Abbot; but be ſure you keep your word upon the penalty of valuing your ſelf hereafter, as much upon the name of an Anti-Janſeniſt, as now you do upon that of a Janſeniſt.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:174113:178"/>
               <p>I accept the condition, replied <hi>Timantes,</hi> ſo certain am I not to hazard much by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. More than you are aware of, ſayd <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> have you ever confronted, or compar'd <hi>Paſcal's</hi> citations, with the texts of the Society's Divines? I have not, anſwer'd he, but we will immediatly do it if you pleaſe. The moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary and unprofitable labor, will be always agreeable, when I undergo it for your ſakes. It is too late to begin it to day, replied <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> do it at your leiſure, but be ſure you do it exactly, and when you think fit give us an account.</p>
               <p>It is fit, ſayd the Abbot, that we ſhou'd make this peece of drudgery as eaſy to you as is poſſible, conſidering that to a perſon of your brisk, lively humor, ſuch a task ſhou'd not be a very pleaſant paſtime. I will therefore quit you for four or five points: of which the firſt ſhall be, to ſhew, in the aſſertions, or principles of one ſingle Jeſuit, the whole, or the leaſt part of what is attributed to all the body in the fourth Letter, concerning the ſins of libertins, or harden'd and impious men. The ſecond, to make good the accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in the fifth Letter, of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Idolatry to the new Chriſtians in <hi>China,</hi> and of their having, for that end, put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, the direction of intention, and teaching their Converts, that they may outwardly adore Idols, provided they do but inwardly direct their adorations to a Crucifix, hid under their garments; and that alſo which is added, that
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:174113:178"/>theſe Fathers do not expoſe in that country in the aſſemblies of their new Converts, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, but only diſcourſe to 'um of the glorious Myſteries of our Savior, without ſaying any thing of a ſuffering Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The third, is, to juſtify <hi>Paſcal's</hi> honeſty and fidelity in reference to <hi>Filiucius's</hi> paſſage, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſts. The fourth, is, to ſhew, in <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> the paſſage quoted by <hi>Paſcal</hi> concerning ſimony. <hi>If a temporal good be given for a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, that is to ſay, mony for a benefice, and that the mony be given as the price of the benefice, it is plain ſimony. But if it be given as a motive to induce the benefic'd perſon to reſign,</hi> NON TAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAM PRETIUM BENEFICII, SED TANQUAM MOTIVUM AD RESIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANDUM, <hi>it is no ſimony.</hi> The fifth, is, to tell us, what right he had to cut away from, or diſmember the text of <hi>Bauni,</hi> touching the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation a Prieſt is under, of ſaying the Maſſes he has agreed for, with him who gives the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution. This text, whole and intire, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have nothing in it, but what all men may, and ought to allow, nor any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> do's oppoſe. If you give me but a good account of theſe five points only, continu'd the Abbot, I ſhall be wholly yours, and purſuant to <hi>Eudoxus's</hi> propoſal, change my ſide. That ſhall not hinder, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Timantes</hi> confidently.</p>
               <p>If you fail in your undertaking, added the Abbot, I will not, however, oblige you, to change your party, at leaſt till I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:174113:179"/>you of ſome other things: which if I do not do, I will own my ſelf vanquiſh'd and ſubmit. 1. If I do not clearly ſhew you, that the doctrin of probability, is not an invention of the Jeſuits; that it is not peculiar to them; and that they do not teach it, but with a croud of Doctors of all Schooles, all Orders, and all Nations; that they do not teach it, in the manner <hi>Paſcal</hi> pretends; and that what he ſays of it in his Letters, is full of falſifications and impoſtures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If I do not juſtify the Jeſuits touching the Idolatry of <hi>China,</hi> by authentic peeces, and records, by moſt full and poſitive teſtimonies, ſuch as will make you admire the boldneſs and impudence of the Societys enemies. 3. If I take not from you, all doubts and ſcruples, concerning the innocence and purity of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's</hi> doctrin of ſimony, and that of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> about Alms.</p>
               <p>You ſpeak, ſayd <hi>Timantes,</hi> interrupting him, and very much aſtoniſh'd, with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and aſſurance. Do's not <hi>Paſcal,</hi> in his former Letters, ſet down the very articles, pages and numbers, of the Jeſuit authors he quotes? do's he not put all his extracts out of them into <hi>Italic</hi> letters? he do's ſo, anſwer'd the Abbot, both in his former and in his latter Letters; and this draws the belief of all thoſe, who do not examin the texts and compare them with his quotations, and the indignation, of all thoſe, who do give themſelves that trouble.</p>
               <p>What, ſayd <hi>Timantes, Paſcal</hi> the honeſteſt
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:174113:179"/>man of his time, to falſify, impoſe, and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate? you are certainly in jeſt, this is not poſſible: nor cou'd any thing be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, according to the character I have had of him from good and able men of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
               <p>Let him be as honeſt a man as you will, anſwer'd the Abbot, what I ſay are matters of fact; which I undertake to prove; and when I have done it, chooſe whether you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for him the quality of an honeſt man, or give that of cheats, impoſtors, falſifiers and calumniators, to thoſe, who furniſh'd him with memorials and extracts againſt the Jeſuits. Make this diviſion how you think fit, it is very indifferent to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know, ſayd <hi>Cleander,</hi> that what Mr. Abbot promiſes you to do, he has already done for us; and what he has affirm'd, we have ſeen, with our own eyes, in the authors themſelves, having actually confronted and compar'd the Provincial Letters, page by page, with the texts, cited juſt as they follow in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without any choice; and that, except one or two inconſiderable points, which <hi>Paſcal</hi> had reaſon to find fault with, theſe Letters are one continued ſeries, or complication of falſifies and impoſtures; which prepoſſeſſes a man with a terrible prejudice againſt the other articles, concerning the greateſt part whereof, he has offer'd to undeceive us when ever we pleaſe?</p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:174113:180"/>
               <p>The Jeſuits, anſwer'd the Abbot, are ſo little of the opinions aſcrib'd to them by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> that they wou'd, without heſitating, ſubſcribe to the condemnation of moſt of the propoſitions he contends againſt, taken in the ſenſe he gives them. But that, which is wonderful, and a new calumny of their enemies is, that theſe propoſitions, for the greater part, as <hi>Paſcal</hi> has fram'd 'um, the better to refute 'um, having been moſt juſtly condem'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was every where reported, that it was the Societys doctrin, which was there condem'd. The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in <hi>France,</hi> have ſuffer'd all this to be ſayd, and indeed, they have done well, not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves much about the matter. But the Flemiſh Fathers had not ſo much patience. For, they have fully demonſtrated, that hardly any one of the condem'd propoſitions, had been taught by the Jeſuits; and if any one of them be found, in one or two Divines of the Society, they were neither the firſt, nor the only perſons that taught them; but that there had been always, ſome non-Jeſuit Divines, eſpecially among the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> who lead the van: and that for one Jeſuit, who fell in with thoſe opinions, the main part, or body of the Divines of the Society, were of a contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>Theſe are very ſtrange things, which you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, ſayd <hi>Timantes</hi> interrupting him; and I am apt to believe, that what you ſay of <hi>Paſcals</hi> being furniſh'd with falſe memoirs, might have happen'd to your ſelf; and that the Jeſuits,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:174113:180"/>impos'd upon you, and perſwaded you they were true: but be it as it will, ſince you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have been already fully inform'd in this matter; it is not my buſineſs any longer to make head againſt, or oppoſe you, at leaſt, till I have ſatisfied my ſelf, and taken the ſame pains, that you have done. Let us therefore, for the preſent take our leave of this ſubject, and talk of other things.</p>
               <p>And thus ended the diſcourſe upon this matter, whereof <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> did not expect ſo moderate a concluſion from their Janſeniſt: whom the Abbot's flegme and ſtaid temper, had, all along, kept within certain bounds, which, on ſuch like occaſions, had been very uſual for him to tranſgreſs.</p>
               <div type="part">

                  <head>OF THE DISTINCTION OF Probable in Practice, AND Probable in Speculation.</head>
                  <p>THIS diſtinction, which ſome Divines have made uſe of in their deciſions, has, from time to time, very much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded <hi>Paſcal:</hi> It has made many of his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerys, which he believ'd the moſt witty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come falſe and inſipid and his moſt vehement invectives appear altogether impertinent, and not at all to the purpoſe; and I am perſwaded, this was one of the diſtinctions he was moſt afraid of.</p>
                  <p>My buſineſs now, is, to diſcover the ſenſe of this diſtinction, whether it be ſolid, uſeful, or even neceſſary in Morals; or whether it be only an artifice, by which the Jeſuits have ſerv'd themſelves <hi>To ruin Religion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Let. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>without ſenſibly wounding the ſtate:</hi> this is <hi>Paſcals</hi> own expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, there always was a great deal of difference, between the practice and ſpeculation,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:174113:181"/>in an infinit number of ſubjects, eſpecially in matters of Morals. But not to dwell upon a common place, let us examin, whether this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, may be admitted, even in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wherein <hi>Paſcal</hi> condems and raillys it: it is upon the chapter of murder and other violent acts, whereof he has ſpoken in his ſeventh and thirteenth Letters.</p>
                  <p>As all this writers artifice and cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in confounding things, ſo the Jeſuits whole juſtification upon this point, ought to conſiſt, in a plain unfolding and explication of the matter; in order to this, I will firſt preſuppoſe ſome propoſitions, the truth of which none can deny.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When it is ask'd, whether, on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, it be lawful to kill, or ſtrike, it is, always, without prejudice to the Evangelical Counſel; where our Savior bid us <hi>Not to reſiſt a wicked man, that treats us ill: to turn our left cheek to him that has ſmote us on the right; and to let him have our cloak, that wou'd by violence take away our coat.</hi> There is not a Caſuiſt, who do's not agree, that this conduct, in a Chriſtian, is infinitly to be prais'd, and perfectly heroical.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But as it wou'd be impious, to think otherwiſe, ſo it wou'd be extravagant for a Divine or a Canoniſt, to regulat, by theſe Counſels of Perfection, the ſtrict obligations of a Chriſtian in this matter; and to condem him to hell, becauſe he wou'd go to law with a man, that took away his goods unjuſtly; or becauſe he wou'd defend himſelf againſt a man,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:174113:182"/>that ſhou'd draw his ſword to kill him, or lift up his hand to hit him a box on the ear, or to cudgel him. The queſtion here, is, not what is moſt perfect, but only what is lawful; nor that which is counſell'd, but that which is not forbidden. I made this ſuppoſition, at firſt, to ſhew, what pitiful antitheſes, or oppoſitions <hi>Paſcal</hi> has made, from time to time on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, between theſe Evangelical Counſels, and the doctrin which he attributes to the Jeſuits.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Althô that life, honor, mony, and other temporal goods, are infinitly leſs valuable, than ſpiritual and eternal riches, they are yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goods, and goods which men have a right to keep and defend, againſt thoſe, who wou'd take them away unjuſtly: that this right is founded upon the law of nature, and the right of Nations, authoris'd by the Divine, written Law: that to pretend the contrary, as ſome heretics do, wou'd be to over-turn the order eſtabliſh'd by God, and to give wicked men occaſion of offering violences, and inſulting over good men. It is upon this ground, that all Divines agree with Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in this general maxim:
<note place="margin">2.2. q. 64. a. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Secundùm jura licet vim vi repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere, cum moderamine inculpatae tutelae.</hi> That a man is allow'd, by all kinds of law, to puſh back, or return violence for violence, provided he contains himſelf within, the bounds of a juſt and moderat defence. But all the difficulty is, to define, or determin, what theſe bounds are; and the difficulty is by ſo much the greater, as by how much we are naturally inclin'd and

All hereupon do further agree in the following propoſitions: that a man ought not to do himſelf right, when the wrong done, or intended may be prevented or repair'd, by a ſuperior power: that to avoid death, at leaſt we may take away his life, that attacks us, with a full deſign to take away ours: that the perſon aſſaulted, if he cannot otherwiſe defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, has a right, at leaſt, in ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to do the aggreſſor a greater miſchief, than what he apprehends from him: ſo althô mony and all houſhold-ſtuff, are much leſs valuable than life, yet notwithſtanding,

                  <p>All this being ſuppos'd, certain, there ariſe, upon this ſubject, a thouſand difficulties, of great importance, to be reſolv'd, by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts and Divines: whereof this, which has a relation to the preſent queſtion, is one: it is a caſe decided by the Jeſuit <hi>Reginaldus,</hi> wherein he makes uſe of the diſtinction <hi>Of Probable in Speculation, and Probable in Practice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In praxi, libr. 21. nu. 62.</note> mention'd by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> in his ſeventh Letter. I have choſen this example, becauſe, it is very proper to make the buſineſs in hand be eaſily underſtood:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:174113:183"/>and that, afterwards it will be eaſy to apply, what I ſhall ſay upon this ſubject, to other caſes of this nature, reported by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> in his ſeventh and thirteenth Letters: where the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifications are horrible, eſpecially in the citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the paſſages in <hi>Reginaldus</hi> and <hi>Leſſius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reginaldus,</hi> after he had explain'd the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein it is lawful to take away the life of an unjuſt aggreſſor, adds this which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. <q>It is to be obſerv'd, that, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it is very indifferent, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner an unjuſt aggreſſor undertakes to deſtroy a man he reſolves to kill: whether he makes uſe of arms, poyſon, or falſe evidence; or, whether he do's it, by himſelf, or by another. For what ſignify's it, by what means he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to make me periſh, when once it is ſuppos'd, that the way he takes will have it's effect.</q> From this principle, <hi>Reginaldus</hi> draws many concluſions; the laſt of which <hi>Paſcal</hi> propoſes for an example of the Jeſuits curſed doctrin, concerning murder. Here you may ſee it, not as reported by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> but as it is in the author himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Infine, ſays <hi>Reginaldus,</hi> if I meet you, when you are going to bear a falſe teſtimony againſt me, which is ſure to occaſion my death, ſo as 'tis impoſſible to be avoided, and that I have no other way to eſcape, <hi>Nec alia eſt ratio effugij,</hi> it is lawful for me to take away your life, as from a man that is going to take away mine: for what matter is it, whether you do it, by your ſword, or by the hands of the hangman?</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:174113:183"/>
                  <p>The circumſtances of the caſe carefully to be regarded are, 1. That this adverſary is actually going to execute his wicked deſign againſt me: <hi>Si eas ad ferendum contra me falſum teſtimonium.</hi> 2. That this deſign will be effectual, and it's execution morally certain; <hi>Ex quo accepturus ſim mortis ſententiam.</hi> 3. That I have no other means to avoid it. <hi>Nec alia eſt ratio effugij,</hi> that is to ſay, that I can have no acceſs to the judge, to make my innocence appear; that I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hide my ſelf, nor run away. Without ſpeaking of a fourth condition, which <hi>Reginal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> has put down in the beginning, to wit, that I ought to be ſure of my enemy's ill deſign; and that how ſtrong ſoever the proofs may be, ſo long as there is room to doubt, it is not lawful for me to make uſe of ſuch a precaution. <hi>Notandum eſt primò mihi non licere quidem, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu res dubia eſt, occidere eum à quo mortem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtam mihi parari ſuſpicor; etiamſi vehementia ſint indicia, quòd ita res habeat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet this is not all: not content with theſe precautions, he adds, that, as to this caſe and ſome others of the ſame kind, a man muſt take notice of the advice he gives in another place, in relation to practice, to wit, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 63. <hi>Quoad hoc autem, &amp; alia hujuſinodi, in praxi habenda eſt ratio cautelae proponendae in ſequenti numero 63. verſiculo,</hi> CAETERUM. And there he declares, this concluſion to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, which, as probable as they ſeem in ſpeculation, are not to be follow'd in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; becauſe of the many inconveniences
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:174113:184"/>morally inevitable which attend it; <hi>Quamvis in ſpeculatione pars affirmans non careat omni probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, in praxi tamen non est ſequenda.</hi> Let us now examin the diſtinction of probable in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and of probable in practice, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this caſe. The example will, as I have ſayd, make the thing very eaſy and intelligible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reginaldus's</hi> anſwer in the caſe propounded, is probable in ſpeculation: for what reaſon? becauſe it is founded upon a principle of the law of nature, wherein all the world agrees, that it is lawful for me, to avoid death at the expence of his life, that wou'd infallibly take away mine. Moreover this anſwer, is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence drawn by analogy with this other deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the truth of which, no body makes any doubt; I ſee a man watching and juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to kill me; I have therefore right on my ſide to prevent and kill him if I can.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be deny'd, but that <hi>Reginaldus's</hi> concluſion, conſidering things in themſelves and in general, is rightly infer'd from this principle, and that with probability enuff, and that it alſo has an analogy with the other caſe; which is ſufficiently plain, and admits of no difficulty: for as he ſayd before, 'tis altogether indifferent, whether I looſe my life by poyſon, or by ſteel: whether my enemy kills me with his own, or the common executioners ſword. This is what the Divines call a propoſition probable in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; that is to ſay, with reference to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principles, from whence it is drawn; in the doing whereof, they conſider nothing but
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:174113:184"/>only the principles, and the connexion the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition has with thoſe principles, without regard to any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>But as probable as it is in ſpeculation, it is not probable in practice, ſayd <hi>Reginaldus;</hi> and it ought not to be follow'd <hi>In praxi tamen non eſt ſequenda.</hi> For what reaſon? becauſe the practice wou'd be ſubject to great abuſes; give occaſions of many murders; and alſo becauſe that this thing, of defending ones ſelf, as much founded as it appears to be upon the right of nature, is morally inſeparable from hatred and revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the reaſons of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in number 63. and by which it may eaſily be comprehended, how a propoſition how probable ſoever it may be in ſpeculation, may not yet be always probable in practice. <hi>Reginaldus's</hi> propoſition follows from a principle, receiv'd by all the world, but yet it wou'd have very great inconveniences in practice.</p>
                  <p>I now therefore ask, whether theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions be not true? the firſt; that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is probable in ſpeculation; the ſecond, that, it is not probable in practice? nay are they not even evident? and ſuppoſing them true and evident, is there any ſcandal, or any danger, in advancing, or explaining them in a book of Divinity? cou'd <hi>Reginaldus</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the matter in a more ſevere manner than by ſaying; <hi>In praxi non eſt ſequenda,</hi> this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not to be follow'd in practice?</p>
                  <p>The love of life alone, and the heat of paſſion, in a man, who ſees himſelf upon the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:174113:185"/>point of dying with infamy by the malice of his enemy, will make the right, which, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, he has of killing him, appear, not only probable, but alſo evident; and that without ever having read the arguments, or reflexions of Divines upon the ſubject: he will not ſpend time to weigh, or conſider this principle, but prevent his man if it be poſſible. Who ſhall ſtop him then, in caſe he may be ſtop'd, but his Confeſſor, or ſome friend directed by the doctrin of <hi>Reginaldus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing being thus unfolded, or explain'd, (which was needleſs but for ſuch as have not the leaſt tincture of Divinity) have not the Jeſuits a right to demand juſtice from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic againſt <hi>Paſcal</hi> for the inſolent turn or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which he has made to them, of part of his diſcourſe, on occaſion of this diſtinction in his thirteenth Letter?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>See, ſayd he, in what manner your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons begin to appear under this diſtinction, by means whereof you do but ruin Religion, without wounding, yet ſenſibly the ſtate; whereby you believe your ſelves ſecur'd; for you imagin, the credit you have in the Church, will hinder your being puniſh'd for your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt truth; and that the precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you ſet down to prevent theſe permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from being eaſily practis'd, will ſecure you againſt the Magiſtrats; who not being Judges of caſes of Conſcience, have properly no concern but for the exterior practice. Thus an opinion condem'd under the name
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:174113:185"/>of practice, is made good under the name of ſpeculation: but this baſis, or ground being once eſtabliſh'd, it is not difficult, to raiſe or build upon it the reſt of your maxims.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can there be any thing ſeen more flat or dull, and, at the ſame time, more roguiſh, or more wicked than this diſcourſe? but it was the ſame ſpirit that maintain'd in the thirteenth Letter the calumnies at firſt advanc'd in the ſeventh: and which will clearly appear ſuch, by only comparing <hi>Paſcal's</hi> citations with the texts of the ſeveral Jeſuit authors by him quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I ſhall content my ſelf to inſtance in that which I have newly made uſe of, to explain the diſtinction of probable in ſpeculation, and probable in practice: theſe are the words of his ſeventh Letter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>According to our learned <hi>Reginaldus</hi> in his 21 book, chap. 5. num. 57. <hi>We may alſo kill the falſe witneſſes, which a calumniator has rais'd up againſt us.</hi>
                     </q> If that be <hi>Reginaldus's</hi> propoſition, it is very horrible; ſuppoſing this propoſition true, as general and as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd as it is, there is no calumniator, or falſe witneſs, nor any man that cooperat's to the death of an innocent perſon, that may not in conſcience be kill'd; and it is not to be doubted, but that it deſerves to be anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd. But firſt, hold a little; is this <hi>Reginaldus's</hi> propoſition? where are the circumſtances, ſo wiſely and ſo expreſly ſet down by this Divine, of a preſſing danger, of a certain and inevitable death, without any manner of means either of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:174113:186"/>hiding or eſcaping? circumſtances, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſufficient to other non-Jeſuit Divines, even in practice, to make a man, in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, find the defence juſt and lawful. In one word, he has made <hi>Reginaldus</hi> to ſay abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly and in general, <hi>That the falſe witneſſes rais'd against us may be lawfully kill'd.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding the reſult, or concluſion of his whole doctrin is, as we have ſeen, that one can neither kill, nor counſel the killing of them, even in the moſt preſſing circumſtances. Was there ever any calumny ſo horrid, and ſo extravagant as this?</p>
                  <p>Can a Divine, that concludes, after a ſerious weighing and examining all the difficulties of the queſtion (and it is not to be denied but that there are conſiderable difficulties on both ſides) can a Divine, I ſay, who concludes, as <hi>Reginaldus</hi> has done, be ſuſpected to flatter or indulge our paſſions, and authoriſe revenge? and wou'd not any other, than a Jeſuit, have appear'd to <hi>Paſcal</hi> to have determin'd this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the moſt ſevere manner that was poſſible? muſt not a Jeſuit Divine dare to propoſe the difficulties on one ſide, as well as on the other; nor ſhew, that he perceives what they are? and ſhall he be condem'd of looſe Morals, for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, even the ſtricteſt opinion, becauſe he follows it with ſome doubt? what, may not a Caſuiſt arguing upon this matter ſay? <hi>If we proceed by general principles; if we argue by analogy to ſuch and ſuch other caſes; if we ſtick only to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and the conſideration of the nature of things,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:174113:186"/>this opinion is probable: but if we regard the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which are almoſt inevitable in the practice; if we mind a man's ordinary temper and diſpoſition in ſuch a rencounter, it is not probable, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ought not to be follow'd in practice.</hi> Muſt not a Caſuiſt expreſs himſelf in this manner, althô the ſubject obliges him to do it in a thouſand inſtances? can he not do it without being accus'd to allow that, which he ſays expreſly ought neither to be done nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?</p>
                  <p>The object of this ſcience is practice; and all concluſions which are not practical but purely ſpeculative, are not properly moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; they are no deciſions; they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſequence in reference to actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not the rules of our manners. It is not therefore their deciſions wherewith <hi>Reginaldus</hi> and <hi>Leſſius</hi> are reproach'd in the ſeventh and thirteenth Letters; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their texts are there falſified, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the propoſition, which properly contain their deciſions, are directly contrary to that which is attributed to them.</p>
                  <p>It is however fit not to leave unanſwer'd the objection <hi>Paſcal</hi> makes the Jeſuits upon this ſubject;

                        </gap>.</note> taken from a paſſage in <hi>Eſcobar</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtinction of probable in ſpeculation, and of probable in practice. <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> ſay they, in the firſt of his ſix tomes of Moral Divinity <hi>in the Preface n.</hi> 15. teaches, that every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion in ſpeculation is alſo probable in practice. What a great misfortune it is, that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:174113:187"/>
                     <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſhou'd not be of the ſame opinion with others? but it is not one of the ſecrets of the Society, to make one of their Divines firſt ſay, that an opinion is probable in ſpeculation, and not probable in practice, and afterwards to make another advance, that every opinion probable in ſpeculation, is alſo probable in practice; to the end, that people ſhou'd accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to follow their caprice and their paſſions, and ſo by degrees widen and enlarge their Conſciences for the committal of the greateſt crimes?</p>
                  <p>No doubt but <hi>Reginaldus</hi> writ to <hi>Eſcobar</hi> from <hi>Lyons</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to concert with him this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant artifice: or, that their General himſelf took care to make this diviſion of doctrin with ſo commendable and holy proſpects. Oh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious cunning of that thought! by which we are almoſt return'd to that wonderful ſecret, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by <hi>Paſcal</hi> in his fifth Letter, of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the Directors and Jeſuit Divines with their Superiors, to make ſome of them ſtrict and ſevere, others looſe and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Doctors and Directors: but as ill luck wou'd have it, <hi>Eſcobar</hi> agrees with the reſt, even in this point, and if there be any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or diſpute between them, it is but a diſpute of words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in his <hi>Examen Confeſſariorum,</hi> ſtil'd in the Provincial Letters, <hi>The four and twenty old men's collection,</hi> he thinks and ſpeaks upon this ſubject after the uſual manner as <hi>Paſcal</hi> himſelf confeſſes; and as for his book of Moral Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:174113:187"/>where he ſays, that what is lawful in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, is lawful alſo in practice, if <hi>Paſcal</hi> had read on a few pages beyond that cited he wou'd have perfectly underſtood this Caſuiſts meaning; which is very good, and which has, in reality, nothing in it contrary to what he had ſayd elſewhere, nor to what is ſayd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. His words are theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If after having foreſeen the inconveniences ariſing from practice, I yet probably judge,
<note place="margin">Lib 2. theol. mor. prob. 5.</note> that this practice is lawful, I may accordingly make uſe on't. But yet nevertheleſs I do acknowledge every thing which is lawful, is not always expedient, becauſe of outward circumſtances. And moreover, if the Prince, or ſupreme Tribunal, ſhou'd forbid it by their declarations or decrees, then the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, contrary to theſe orders, wou'd ceaſe to be probable: for example, there were ſome opinions of <hi>Angelus, Armilla,</hi> and <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> which were probable before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding ſince the Councel, it is no longer lawful to follow them in practice: and therefore for my part; from the time it is ſayd, that an opinion is not probable in practice, I hold that neither it is probable in ſpeculation; becauſe that the inconveniences which are found in the practice, do demonſtrate it's falſity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can all this mean, but that <hi>Eſcobar</hi> wou'd not have an opinion call'd probable in ſpeculation, when, thô never ſo well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon certain general principles; admitted
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:174113:188"/>by all the world, the inconveniences, which are found in practice, do hinder it from being poſſible to be held probable in practice: whereas other Divines wou'd have it, that the inconveniences, which hinder it from being probable in practice, do not hinder, but that it may be ſayd to be probable in ſpeculation, ſo that it appear conformable to the general principles, from whence it is drawn in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable manner. But all do agree, as well as <hi>Eſcobar;</hi> that becauſe of theſe inconveniences, it ought not in practice to be the rule of our actions.</p>
                  <p>To do a pleaſure therefore to <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> I will forbear calling ſuch an opinion probable in ſpeculation; and yet to accommodate my ſelf with others, I wou'd very willingly call it ſo. I ſhou'd not by that wrong any body, and my condeſcendance wou'd be altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſequence as to our manners: and ſo alſo wou'd be, all the other Divines different ways of expreſſing themſelves. According to this notion of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> which has nothing in it but what's very reaſonable, I will ſay, <hi>That one may ſafely follow in practice the opinions which are probable in ſpeculation;</hi> becauſe I ſhall be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd before I call them probable in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are probable in practice, and according to the notion of others, I will ſay, <hi>That it is not lawful to follow in practice all the opinions which are probable in ſpeculation;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the quality of probable in ſpeculation do's not include all that's neceſſary to make
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:174113:188"/>it probable in practice; and I will before all Divines defy <hi>Paſcal,</hi> with all his vain and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical declamations, to gain-ſay, or find fault with this point of my doctrin.</p>
                  <p>Now to make an end, and give a ſhort and preciſe account of all I have ſayd, ſee to what it is reduc'd, according to <hi>Reginaldus</hi> and according to others, to whom they have done the ſame injuſtice. See, I ſay, to what all the myſtery of the diſtinction of probable in in ſpeculation, and of probable in practice is reduc'd. The end of this diſtinction is, firſt to ſhew, that in matter of Morals, it is not enuff to argue by certain general principles, whoſe conſequences, how well ſoever drawn, may ſometimes have very ſad ſequels if by them alone, we ſhou'd govern our actions. And in the ſecond place, that there are many things, which conſider'd in themſelves, and with reference to general rules, do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſins, but yet for all that, it is morally impoſſible to practiſe them without ſin; becauſe, that the corruption of the heart of man, the violence of the paſſions, which the objects do excite, and the vehement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which the preſence of good or evil makes, do ſeldom leave the mind in ſuch an even ſcituation and tranquillity, as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to hinder the tranſgreſſion of thoſe bounds, which reaſon and the laws of God do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. Is then to ſay, that a thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in ſpeculation, and not probable in practice; that it is prohibited to be done,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:174113:189"/>that it ought not to be advis'd, nor it's pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice permitted, to invent an artifice to ruin Religion, and the Goſpel, by only managing the ſtate ſo, as not to wound it openly?</p>
                  <p>But the conduct alone of <hi>Paſcal</hi> and his followers, ſo ſeeming zealous for ſtrict, in oppoſition to looſe Morals, ſufficiently proves, that, generally ſpeaking, there is a great deal of difference between ſpeculation and practice. One equivocation, one mental reſervation, as they affirm, in their books and in their converſations, are damnable ſins; and yet in practice, the lyes, falſifications, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious turns, which they give to the doctrin and opinions of many Religious and Learned Perſons, are the moſt innocent things in the world, and the moſt lawful, provided they do but fall upon the Jeſuits, or ſome of their friends.</p>

                  <p>Let us now endeavor to penetrate into the bottom of this ſecret alſo, and diſcover it to the world better than <hi>Paſcal</hi> has done. The whole doctrin of the direction of intention conſiſts, in teaching, that in things that are of themſelves indifferent, the intention, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is good or bad, makes an action either good or bad; that a good action ceaſes to be good, for want of a good intention, and that, generally ſpeaking, the intention, is a thing of that conſequence in Morals, that it makes, in a thouſand inſtances, the only eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference of our actions; or to expreſs my ſelf in the language of the School's, it is that, which form's, or conſtitutes every one of our actions in their ſeveral ſpecies or kinds.</p>
                  <p>I cou'd, by following the Janſeniſts method, fill the text and margent of this ſmall writing, with an infinity of paſſages out of the holy Fathers, concerning the Intention; but I will
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:174113:190"/>content my ſelf with two words, taken from Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſs, all that is comprehended in the propoſition I have now lay'd down.

It is in this ſenſe alſo, that the Fathers underſtand the words of the Son of God in the Goſpel: <hi>If your eye be clear,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>your whole body will be full of light.</hi> That is to ſay, if your intention be pure, what you act will not be a work of darkneſs: ſo that this principle of Divinity, has nothing in it, but what is highly orthodox and reaſonable: it is very common and very neceſſary, and therefore to call it <hi>wonderful</hi> and make it a ſecret of the Jeſuits policy, is the moſt abſurd and the moſt ridiculous thing in the world.</p>
                  <p>But, perhaps the Jeſuits abuſe it in the uſage, by a wrong, or an impertinent applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to ſome matters. I do not intend here to refute, at large, all <hi>Paſcal's</hi> calumnies upon this occaſion. I will content my ſelf, with ſingling out, or pointing at a few; and ſhewing in two words, that the Jeſuits appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this principle to the ſeveral ſubjects, is neither impious, nor extravagant: particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the matter of ſimony, of uſury and of violence; wherein they are reproach'd by the Provincial Letters, to have made uſe of the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:174113:190"/>direction of intention. <hi>Valentia</hi> ſays, that a man may, ſometimes, give a temporal good for a ſpiritual: <hi>Eſcobar</hi> holds, that a man may expect ſome advantage for lending a ſum of mony: <hi>Reginaldus</hi> tells us, that we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times purſue and beat a man that has inſulted and affronted us; and all this without ſin, provided, that the intention be well directed. And <hi>Bauni</hi> preſcribes, even an expreſs form reported in the eighth Letter, where the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of intention is put into practice, to make a contract lawful.</p>
                  <p>Abſtracting from <hi>Paſcal's</hi> railleries, and the malicious turn he gives theſe things, which is not now the matter in queſtion, is it never lawful to purſue, to beat, or to kill an unjuſt aggreſſor? it is ſometimes, without doubt; and it is even always lawful, when a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains himſelf within the bounds of a juſt and moderat defence, <hi>Cum moderamine inculpatae tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telae.</hi> In continuing within theſe bounds, may not he, who defends himſelf, have a good, or an ill intention in beating him, by whom he is attack'd? may he not do it to be reveng'd, or may he not do it only to defend himſelf? it is certain, it may be done either of theſe two ways; and therefore the direction of intention may very well take place in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Is it never lawful to give a ſpiritual for a temporal good, or to make profit of one's mony? without doubt nothing is more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: the Prieſts daily receive mony for their
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:174113:191"/>Maſſes, and men do hourly make contracts of partnerſhip, and contracts for a yearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; if I give a Prieſt mony as a payment of his Maſs, I am guilty of ſimony; but if my intention be to give it only out of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of pure gratitude, or for alms, or for ſome ſuch motive. I am not guilty of ſimony.</p>
                  <p>I have given a man twenty thouſand pounds, at five in the hundred, if at twenty years end he pays back my principal, he will find that for twenty which I gave him, I ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd forty: with what conſcience, and by what rule of equity, can I receive back as much more as I pay'd? if in giving out this mony, I intended to purchaſe a right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving yearly a thouſand pound out of an eſtate of land, for example, that was mortgag'd to me, I do nothing againſt juſtice; but if I had only an intention to employ my mony, to get by it a great deal more than I gave, I become an Uſurer: if in giving my mony to a Merchant to be made uſe of in his trade, on condition that he will reſtore it with profit, for example, at five in the hundred, I become this way alſo an Uſurer; but if I have a real intention to enter into partnerſhip with him, my conſcience is ſecure.</p>
                  <p>Since the intention then in matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, is always eſſential to make them valid, or lawful; and ſince when a man is to defend his life, his fortune or his honor, the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is one of the things that contributes to the making this defence juſt and lawful; why
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:174113:191"/>ſhou'd not the Jeſuit Divines be allow'd, as well as others, to teach, that in theſe matters, if a man will not ſin, he muſt take care to act with a good intention?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valentia,</hi> in his treatiſe of ſimony, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the queſtion juſt as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> did, he handled the ſame caſes, and reſolv'd many of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>um, as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> had done, by the direction of intention. Why ſhou'd the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of intention be a moſt innocent thing in Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and yet in <hi>Valentia</hi> be a wicked thing, and a myſtery of the Jeſuits policy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bauni</hi> expounds the manner of making a contract by which men may lawfully make profit of their mony; and by doing of it otherwiſe they wou'd be guilty of Uſury; what evil is there in this? now to ſpeak truth, he do's in this example ſuppoſe the doctrin <hi>of three contracts;</hi> but he is neither the author, nor the only defender of it: it was maintain'd before him by abundance of very learned non-Jeſuit Canoniſts and Divines: being alſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſo much practis'd as it is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and the direction of intention not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more forc'd, or ſtrain'd in that, than in many other contracts, which are allow'd; why muſt it be a crime in him, to follow it, as long as neither the Church, nor the Eccleſiaſtic Superiors have thought fit to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſays, that it is Uſury to exact any thing above the principal, on account of the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:174113:192"/>loan; but that to hope by lending mony to a perſon that wants it, for example to buy a peece of land that lyes conveniently for him, one ſhou'd get his friendſhip by the pleaſure he do's him, or ſome favor upon occaſion, is not Uſury even in thought; nor is it Uſury in act, when afterwards, by putting him in mind of the pleaſure he did him, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to excite his gratitude, that he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtain from him the ſervice he ſtands in need of; what is there unjuſt, or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this diſtinction? muſt a man paſs for an Uſurer for doing ſuch an act of kindneſs for another, who he foreſees is like to be within a little time, in a condition and credit to ſerve him? do men look upon the good offices they receive on ſuch accounts as Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? and is there need of any thing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe to juſtify thoſe who are here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd with ſo much malice, or ſo much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?</p>
                  <p>Infine, when <hi>Reginaldus</hi> teaches, that it is probable in ſpeculation, but very rarely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in practice; that in ſome circumſtances which he ſets down, and of which <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays not one word, a man may, but yet in the inſtant only wherein he is offended, purſue the perſon from whom he receives the affront, he gives notice, that this muſt not be done, with an intention to do evil for evil, but only to do that, which is neceſſary and no more, to ſave his honor; is this reſtriction unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or capable to empoyſon his anſwer? can
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:174113:192"/>this deciſion with all the precautions which attend it, be more abus'd than the example of <hi>David</hi> may, who commands <hi>Salomon</hi> to rid himſelf of <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Shimei</hi> upon the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that offers? without the direction of intention, what ſhou'd we think of this order of <hi>David?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, neither <hi>Reginaldus</hi> nor the others have here advanc'd any thing new, touching this direction of intention. They have ſayd, but with <hi>Innocent</hi> III, that all laws do allow men to repel force by force; not with an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to revenge, but to defend themſelves.

                  <p>What then have the Jeſuit Divines done in this matter? they have taught, that a good intention, on theſe occaſions, was ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that, without it, men may be guilty of great ſins; and what has <hi>Paſcal</hi> done? he has turn'd the thing quite otherwiſe, in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Jeſuits made uſe of this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of intention, to excuſe the moſt horrible of ſins. The Jeſuits have advertis'd, that, in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:174113:193"/>the moſt juſt defence, a man muſt take care, not to ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported with paſſion, that he muſt have no other intention than that of defending himſelf: and <hi>Paſcal</hi> by falſifying and diſmembring the writings of the Jeſuits, has given out, that they excuſe the greateſt crimes and violences, provided men have but a good intention in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittal.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuits have taught, that in giving a ſpiritual good for a temporal (and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is not of giving ready mony for a benefice, but Prayers, Maſſes, Foundations and ſuch other things) one muſt, on theſe occaſions, have no intention of giving the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good, as the price of the ſpiritual; but that one muſt have another intention, which is, to engage the perſon out of gratitude, to Pray to God for him, to ſay Maſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Paſcal</hi> upon this, Prints without ceremony, or any more ado, that <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Tanner</hi> had ſucceeded admirably in juſtifying the traffic that is driven now a days for benefices.</p>
                  <p>After he had reported what Father <hi>Bauni</hi> had ſayd, to exclude from a contract an Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious intention, and had put into his Letter the good Fathers bad <hi>French,</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was moſt proper to make men laugh and ridicule it; he makes his Jeſuit ſay, very inſipidly: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury conſiſts, according to our Fathers, almost in nothing but the intention of taking this profit as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurious; and it is for this reaſon, that our Father</hi> Eſcobar <hi>makes the ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury to be
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:174113:193"/>avoided by a plain ſimple turn of the intention.</hi> And at the ſame time he reports, or rather cites the paſſage in <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> of which I have juſt now ſpoken, and quotes it for a ridiculous deciſion; althô it be impoſſible to decide it otherwiſe without madneſs or extravagance. This then at laſt is the great All they can make the direction of intention amount to, with which the Society has been ſo much reproach'd. <hi>This wonderful principle in the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Morals, the importance of which wou'd make one almoſt, compare it to the Doctrin of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all, we leave it to God to judge of <hi>Paſcal's</hi> intention in his moſt unjuſt and cruel perſecution of the Jeſuits. It is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that he might have had the ſame end and deſigns, and have been actuated with the ſame kind of ſpirit, wherewith the Abbot of Saint <hi>Cyran,</hi> the Saint and Oracle of the party, was at laſt found to have been inſpir'd; who upon a time, confidently ſayd to the Abbot of <hi>Priéres;</hi>

                  <p>ONCE more, let us begin with <hi>Paſcal's</hi> text in his ninth Letter, where the Jeſuit makes this following diſcourſe. <q>I wou'd willingly now talk to you of the eaſy methods we have found out, to avoid the ſins people are apt to fall into in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and in the intrigues and tranſactions of the world. One of the moſt troubleſome things in theſe occaſions, is, to avoid lying; and eſpecially when they wou'd have a thing that is falſe believ'd to be true: for which purpoſe, our doctrin of Equivocations is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable: by which it is lawful, to make uſe of ambiguous terms, to make them be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a different ſenſe from the ſpeaker's own meaning, as <hi>Sanchez, op. mor. p.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 13. I know that very well, Father, ſayd I; we have publiſh'd ſo much, continu'd he, that, at laſt, all the world is ſufficiently inſtructed in the matter. But do you know, what muſt be done when equivocal words are not to be found? I do not, ſayd I; I queſtion'd it very much, anſwer'd he, for the thing is new: it is the doctrin of mental reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Oh how agreeable and diverting is all this! there is really nothing wanting but truth to make it ſo. For if <hi>Paſcal</hi> has not here made uſe of equivocations, or mental reſervations, he has ly'd, at leaſt, three or four times, as ſhall be ſoon perceiv'd. This matter is not a little curious, and there are very few people, that underſtand it, as it ought to be underſtood. I will collect and put together all the ſtrongeſt and beſt arguments, on both ſides, that have been made uſe of, upon this ſubject: for I will not in this matter adopt any opinion for my own.

But I do not intend to draw from thence any advantage for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. My deſign, is, to examin things in themſelves without prejudice or prepoſſeſſion; and only to make appear how difficult it is to make a right choice in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Althô equivocations and mental reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are often confounded together, there is, notwithſtanding, a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other. Every propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that has more ſenſes than one, is call'd <hi>Equivocal;</hi> and that alſo which the ſpeaker fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees the hearer will take in a different ſenſe or meaning from that which he gives it in his
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:174113:195"/>own mind. Such was the anſwer of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he told the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> that <hi>Sara</hi> was his Siſter; foreſeeing that they wou'd take this word Siſter in another ſignification, than that which he himſelf gave it. It is call'd a mental reſervation, when a propoſition, which, being literally taken, appears to be falſe, but being reſtrain'd by ſomething that I retain in my mind it is found to be true. A man, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that is earneſtly importun'd by an other to lend him mony, tells him, <hi>I have none.</hi> This anſwer is falſe, but it wou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come true, if it were joyn'd with the words, <hi>to lend you,</hi> which he did not add.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is no manner of doubt, but that, in theſe equivocations and reſtrictions, there is ſomething, which at firſt ſight, appears oppoſit, or contrary to ſincerity and ſimplicity, or ſingle heartedneſs; which often ſeems to be very odd and unnatural; but after all, thoſe, who are concern'd in this diſpute, have a right to deſire the reader to ſuſpend his judgment for a few moments, till he has examin'd the reaſons on both ſides; let us therefore grant them this favor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All Catholic Doctors unanimouſly agree, that it is never lawful to tell a ly; and that a ly, being an ill thing of it's own nature, no reaſon, no cauſe, nor any motive can poſſibly make it lawful.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This principle, once lay'd down and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of all as indubitable, has occaſion'd many great difficulties in Divinity, as well in
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:174113:196"/>reference to practice in ſome conjunctures, as on account of the expoſition and meaning of ſeveral paſſages in holy Scripture. Men are oblig'd on ſeveral occaſions to ſpeak in a very particular manner, which manner of ſpeaking ſeems hard to be reconcil'd, or made conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with ſincerity. As to the Scripture, when God, or the bleſſed Saints, or Angels do ſpeak in it, it is not lawful to ſay, there is any thing of a ly; and when it only reports the words of ſome perſons commended in it, and whom we are to eſteem as great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servants of God, it is alſo very hard to find in their ſayings any thing contrary to truth. Notwithſtanding there are paſſages of both theſe kinds in Scripture, which have been very difficult and puzzling to Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and coſt even the Holy Fathers, in all times, no ſmall pains to explicate them aright.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe two ſorts of difficulties, without which, in all appearance, none wou'd have ever thought of asking, whether the uſage of equivocations and mental reſervations be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, were the cauſe, that many Divines, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Scripture, Canoniſts of every School and every Country, have accounted them, even neceſſary, on ſeveral occaſions: but yet nevertheleſs, ſtraitening them within bounds much more narrow, than they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, who, under this pretence, have undertaken to decry and run down their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. For all the Doctors, who have handled this ſubject fully and at large, do

Since on one ſide theſe difficulties I ſpeak of are the principal proofs of thoſe, who are for this cuſtom, and that on the other, the conſequences, which it ſeems to draw after it, are the ſtrongeſt arguments of thoſe who are againſt it: my main buſineſs in this diſcourſe ſhall be, to oppoſe the one to the other, and to conſider and weigh them exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without diſſembling, or concealing any thing, that may raiſe the value, or give the advantage to either ſide. In the next place, I will examin whether the Jeſuit <hi>Sanchez,</hi> who is by name and moſt ſtrongly attack'd upon this point be guilty; and whether his accuſer has done him juſtice or injuſtice. Here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the chief reaſons of thoſe, who abſolutly condem the uſage of equivocations and mental reſervations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they ſay, they are palliated lyes, and the expoſition alone, that is made of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of equivocal propoſitions, either in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or in particular, in the examples brought, do ſhew, that they are but ſubtilties, invented on purpoſe, to perſwade us, that men do not ly, when they ſpeak moſt expreſly againſt their thought.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, the deſign and effect of the one and the other, is to deceive and lead into error thoſe we ſpeak to.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, they tend to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:174113:197"/>of civil ſociety and human converſation: for if he, that ſpeaks to me, be perſwaded, that equivocations and reſervations are not lyes, how ſhall I know, that he do's not actually make uſe of them, even at the moment he ſeems to me to ſpeak, with the greateſt ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſimplicity imaginable?</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, the paſſages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the Fathers which inſpire me with horror againſt double dealing, and make elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums of the contrary vertues, do viſibly fight againſt double meaning words and anſwers; which makes the man who hears me, take up quite different notions from what I ſeem willing he ſhou'd conceive. Infine, theſe ſubtilties are new, and altogether unknown to the men of old. This is the ſum, or preciſe account, of all that can be ſayd againſt equivocations and mental reſervations. Let us now ſee what is ſayd to defend them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, an infinit number of Divines and Canoniſts, who after much meditation upon this matter, cou'd not reſolve abſolutly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem their uſage, do agree, that they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the force of theſe arguments; they wou'd yield to them with all their hearts, if they cou'd find out ſome other better ſecret, to avoid certain troubles and abundance of inconveniences, to which human ſociety wou'd find it ſelf expos'd, in caſe that equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and mental reſervations were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly forbidden.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that, they believe them founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:174113:197"/>the practice of Saints, on occaſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not condem'd by the Scripture, nor by the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, and where they are often defended by other Saints. Let us begin with theſe laſt articles.</p>

But let us come to the examples of ſome Chriſtian Saints.</p>
                  <p>I will ſay nothing of the anſwer of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> who being ask'd whether he had not ſeen a man paſs by, who was purſued for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; anſwer'd, putting his hand into his ſleeve, <hi>He did not paſs this way:</hi> perhaps that ſuch nice men, as I have to do with, wou'd make little account of this, look upon it as an idle ſtory, and give little credit to the writers who report it.</p>
                  <p>The example of Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who flying upon the <hi>Nile</hi> eſcaped, by an anſwer like this, from the hands of thoſe who were ſent by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtat to ſeiſe him, is too well known to need to be here particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. I will tye my ſelf to two others, which hitherto have been leſs ſpoken of: the one, is, of Saint <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the other of Saint <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius,</hi> both great admirers of the doctrin of Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Do's not that, joyn'd with the approbation, which this holy Doctor himſelf has given to the conduct of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the inſtances I have brought down, make a very ſtrong argument for the Divines, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they defend themſelves againſt men,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:174113:199"/>who, every where, value themſelves upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſciples of Saint <hi>Auſtin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paulinus</hi> in a peece of Poëtry,
<note place="margin">Natal. 5.</note> which he compos'd in honor of Saint <hi>Felix</hi> of <hi>Nola,</hi> tells us, that this Saint, being upon the point of being arreſted for a Chriſtian by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who were in queſt of him, God by his miraculous power hinder'd them from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; they ask'd himſelf, where they might find <hi>Felix.</hi> The Saint perceiving, by this enquiry, the ſuccor ſent him by Jeſus Chriſt, and the miracle he wrought in his favor, anſwer'd them, laughing; I know not this <hi>Felix</hi> whom you ſeek for; which made them paſs him by, and proceed.</p>

                     <hi>Perſenſit &amp; ipſe faventis Conſilium Chriſti, ridenſque rogantibus infit: Neſcio Felicem quem quaeritis. Illicet illi Praetereunt ipſum.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>It is not to be doubted, but that, if <hi>Felix</hi> had told a ly upon this occaſion, he wou'd have made a very ſcurvy return to the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs our bleſſed Savior ſhew'd: but if he did not tell a ly, what can we think, but that he had recourſe to the equivocation of the name of <hi>Felix,</hi> or to ſome mental reſervation? it ſeems otherwiſe impoſſible to ſave him from a ly.</p>
                  <p>But a plainer and more expreſs equivocation, is not to be met with,
<note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> than that of Saint <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius:</hi> it is in his life, written by the Deacon <hi>Ferrand,</hi> his Diſciple, and dedicated to Biſhop
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:174113:199"/>
                     <hi>Felician,</hi> this Saint's Succeſſor in the Biſhopric of <hi>Ruſpa.</hi> This Deacon reports, that Saint <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> whilſt a Monk, having ſuffer'd great perſecution in <hi>Africa,</hi> took a reſolution to go and viſit the Solitarys or Hermits of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of whom he had heard wonderful things: he took his way thrô <hi>Sicily,</hi> and landed at <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> whereof Saint <hi>Eulalius</hi> was Biſhop; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quitting intirely his Monaſtic profeſſion. The holy Prelat receiv'd <hi>Fulgentius</hi> into his Monaſtery, as he us'd to do other ſtrangers, whom he treated with great hoſpitality. He diſcover'd in two conferences he had with him, the extraordinary merit of this paſſenger, and preſs'd him to tell him the cauſes that made him quit <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> ſays the author of his life, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending he ſhou'd be guilty of vanity, if he ſhou'd acknowledge the motive that made him go into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> anſwer'd him in theſe terms, I am going to ſeek my parents, who I hear are travelling in that country: <hi>Parentes meos requiro, quos illis in partibus vivere peregrinos audivi.</hi> The Biſhop, having ſome ſuſpicion that he did not ſpeak ſincerely, and half diving into the ſenſe of this ambiguous anſwer, learnt from another Monk, who thoſe were whom <hi>Fulgentius</hi> meant by the word <hi>parentes;</hi> in ſo much that Saint <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> ſeeing himſelf diſcover'd, was oblig'd to confeſs the truth. But ſayd the hiſtorian, he might truly call thoſe his parents, whoſe examples he intended to imitate.</p>
                  <p>If that be not a full and formal equivocation,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:174113:200"/>there never was any: for Saint <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſeem'd to take the word <hi>parentes</hi> in it's ordinary ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and yet really intended by it thoſe, who were to be his Fathers in Chriſt; and he alſo gave to the word <hi>perregrinos,</hi> a ſenſe as metaphorical as this was, underſtanding that thoſe he ſpoke of were travellers upon earth, advancing or going on to the celeſtial country.</p>
                  <p>You ſee then, that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> approves the couduct of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and that Saint <hi>Paulinus</hi> do's approve that of Saint <hi>Felix:</hi> you ſee alſo, what has been practis'd by Saint <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> by Saint <hi>Felix</hi> himſelf and Saint <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> which ſeems manifeſtly to authoriſe equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and mental reſervations: it appears to me, there needs little more to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion in this matter.</p>
                  <p>But the Divines, whoſe doctrin I here explain, do believe they have yet ſomething ſtronger to ſupport it. They pretend, that the uſage of reſervations and equivocations cannot, in prudence be abſolutly condem'd, without having firſt ſeriouſly reflected upon certain places of the Goſpel, where they ſeem to be practis'd.</p>
                  <p>What, ſay they, is this thing call'd equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? it is an ambiguous word, that has ſeveral ſignifications, or a propoſition compos'd of ambiguous or doubtful term's, which the ſpeaker foreſees ought to be taken by thoſe, who hear it in another ſenſe or meaning, than he himſelf underſtands it in; of which there are two plain examples in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>In Saint <hi>John Cap.</hi> 11. the Son of God ſayd
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:174113:200"/>to his Diſciples: Lazarus <hi>our friend ſleepeth, but I go that I may awake him out of ſleep.</hi> It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this is an equivocal propoſition: it is alſo certain, that the Apoſtles took it in it's natural ſignification. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſayd they, <hi>if he ſleeps, he ſhall do well.</hi> It is alſo certain, that our Savior foreſaw they wou'd take it ſo. <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſayd the Goſpel, <hi>ſpake of his death, but they thought that he had ſpoken of taking reſt in ſleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond example, is taken out of the ſecond chapter of the ſame Evangeliſt, where our Lord ſayd to the Jews, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple and I will build it up again in three days.</hi> He ſpoke of his body, and the Jews thought, as naturally enuff they might, that he ſpoke of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is very well known, that our Savior had no ill intention in ſpeaking after this manner; and that what he aim'd at, was not to deceive thoſe he ſpoke to; but that ſignifies nothing; for ſay the Divines we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem as a ſin all equivocations, that may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly wrong any other perſon whatſoever, and all thoſe whereby the ſpeakers have a deſign to deceive and ſurpriſe their hearers.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo found in the Goſpel mental reſervations, and that not made out by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or by conſequences, but ſuch as appear, to every reader, formal enuff and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficiently evident.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh chapter of Saint <hi>John, The Brethren of Jeſus ſayd to him, depart hence and go into</hi> Judea. Our Savior anſwers: <hi>Go yee up unto this feaſt;</hi> but as for me, I will not go. <hi>Non
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:174113:201"/>aſcendam: having ſo ſayd,</hi> adds the Evangeliſt, <hi>be abode ſtill in</hi> Galilee; <hi>but when his Brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but as it were in ſecret. Non manifeſtè ſed quaſi in occulto.</hi> This propoſition, <hi>Non aſcendo ad diem feſtum iſtum,</hi> conſider'd preciſely, according to the words, wou'd be falſe, but by adding to it this word <hi>manifeſtè</hi> which our Savior had in his mind, it becomes true.</p>
                  <p>I know what reflexions were made by the Cretics upon this paſſage, becauſe of the variety of the Greek manuſcripts; but I alſo know the invincible reaſons by which it is prov'd, that the reading of our Vulgata in this place, is certainly the true reading. Here are alſo two other paſſages, wherewith I will end the proofs which theſe Divines believe they may draw from the authority of Scripture to confirm their opinion.</p>
                  <p>One is taken out of the thirteenth chapter of Saint <hi>Mark;</hi> where after our Savior had made his Diſciples a deſcriprion of the terrible things that ſhou'd happen at the day of Judgment, he adds, <hi>But of that day and of that hour knoweth no man; no not the Angels which are in heaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Son; but the Father only.</hi> We are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, bound to believe, that the Son of God did really know that day; and from the beginning the <hi>Agnoitae</hi> were accounted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, for ſaying, that our Lord did not know it; and the Greeks call'd them by that name, to ſhew, that their error conſiſted, partly in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting this ignorance to the Son of God. The
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:174113:201"/>
                     <hi>Arians</hi> wou'd have made uſe of this paſſage againſt the Catholics; but the Fathers refuted them with all the zeal and ſtrength that was poſſible.</p>
                  <p>This propoſition, ſay the Divines, wou'd then be falſe, if taken expreſly according to the terms: <hi>The Son of God knows neither the day nor the hour of the laſt Judgment.</hi> It muſt needs follow by conſequence, that the truth of this very propoſition depends upon a ſenſe, that our Savior gives to theſe words, and which is not expreſs'd by the words themſelves; that is to ſay, that in ſpeaking them, he had beſides a particular meaning, or underſtood ſomething elſe, which was only in his own mind; and which therefore, conclude they, cou'd be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a mental reſervation.</p>
                  <p>But that which is remarkable is, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and particularly Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> gives us, when he explains this paſſage, a form of mental reſervations, exactly like that which the Divines propoſe. Our Lord, according to Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayd, that he knew not, when the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wou'd be; not, that he was really igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, but becauſe he knew it, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, or, as may be ſayd, to betray it,
<note place="margin">In Pſal. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>ad prodendum. Ipſi judici occultum eſſe dictum eſt, non ad cognoſcendum, ſed ad prodendum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us here ſet down the example, which is commonly made uſe of, to explain what a mental reſervation is; my Father's enemy is in queſt of him to kill him, he asks me where he is? I make anſwer, that I do not know; this anſwer, is likewiſe falſe in it ſelf, taking the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:174113:202"/>terms or words, preciſely as they ſtand; but let us add to them, not by word of mouth, but only by thought, <hi>ad prodendum,</hi> that is to ſay, I do not know where he is to betray him, and then it becomes true, at leaſt in the ſame manner, that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> finds our Savior's propoſition true.</p>
                  <p>Infine, continue theſe Divines, the paſſage in the fifth chapter of the book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears inexplicable without an equivocation or a mental reſervation; and one needs do no more than read it to be convinc'd of that. Old <hi>Tobit</hi> there demands of the Archangel <hi>Raphaël,</hi> whence are you? <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde te habemus?</hi> the Angel anſwers, <hi>ex filijs</hi> Iſraël, <hi>I am an Iſraëlite.</hi> After ſeveral queſtions <hi>Tobit</hi> enquires again, <hi>Of what Tribe, and what family I pray art thou?</hi> The Angel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>do you not ſeek a guide for your Son? what ſignifies it to you, to know my family? but that you may be freed from all fear, I will tell you, that I am Azarias, ego ſum Azarias Ananiae magni filius. Thou art,</hi> reply'd <hi>Tobit, of an illuſtrious ſtock or family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mind how the Divines argue upon this place. In all theſe paſſages, where the propoſitions, taken according to the terms and their natural meaning, are not true, a man is oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that there is in them a ly, or an equivocation, or a mental reſervation. One cannot, without blaſphemy, acknowledge there is a ly; and therefore muſt admit, either an equivocation, or a mental reſervation: and thus, neither an equivocation, nor a mental reſervation, can in their own nature, be ſo ill,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:174113:202"/>as a ly, and one may, with ſome reſtrictions, or conditions, make uſe of them without ſin.</p>
                  <p>Theſe then are the authoritys and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys, that at firſt made the Divines ſuſpend their judgment of a thing, which the firſt idea made them reject; and which made them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude after turning and toſſing about this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and conſidering it on all ſides, as much as was poſſible, that equivocations and mental reſervations cou'd not be lys, nor things in themſelves abſolutly ill: that there were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures and occaſions, wherein they were not at all criminal, and that they were of the nature of certain things, which ordinarily are bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the circumſtances, but which are not bad in themſelves, and which only become ill, by being made uſe of, without neceſſity, and the lawful precautions. But, before I proceed to the other ground or reaſon, upon which the Divines build their doctrin in this matter, it is not amiſs to ſee, what is ſayd againſt it, by thoſe who declare themſelves for the contrary opinion.</p>
                  <p>A very able man, in a work where he has collected and heap'd up a great deal of learning, has found a place for a diſſertation concerning equivocations and mental reſervations, where he puts this propoſition in the front of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. <hi>Mendacium omne lege divinâ retitum eſt,</hi>

                  <p>He proves his poſition, by a number of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, out of the Scripture and the Fathers; and infine he propounds many objections: among theſe objections are to be ſeen part of the difficulties which I have ſet down; there are others alſo, of which I have not ſpoken; but upon which I ſhall make ſome reflexions, by way of inſtance or replication, to the ſolutions by him given. Than which method, nothing can better ſhew the difficulty of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Alexander</hi> anſwers the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> very well, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not ly neither in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor in <hi>Abimelech's</hi> houſe; and he grounds his anſwer upon the authority of Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> and Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> But I wou'd gladly know, what anſwer he wou'd make, if a <hi>Priſcillianiſt,</hi> in caſe there ſtill were any, ſhou'd make him this reply?</p>
                  <p>You ſay, that equivocations and mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are lyes; but it is impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <hi>Abraham</hi> from lying on this occaſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying he made uſe of a mental reſervation, or an equivocation; therefore according to your principles, it muſt be confeſs'd, that he told a ly: this <hi>Priſcillianist</hi> might thus prove the minor of his ſyllogiſme.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent queſtion, we call a propoſition equivocal, which has ſeveral ſenſes or meanings; and which we foreſee will be taken by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom we ſpeak, in another ſenſe than that which we give it in our own mind, and which notwithſtanding is the moſt natural; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we make ſuch a propoſition expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with intention, to hide from him the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:174113:203"/>truth, which by his queſtion he is deſirous to know. Theſe are the characters by which an equivocation appears moſt contrary to ſincerity and comes neareſt to a ly; but it is viſible, that all this agrees perfectly, with the anſwer made by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the circumſtances he was in, when ask'd whether <hi>Sara</hi> was his Wife; and he anſwer'd ſhe was his Siſter; he therefore, on this occaſion, made uſe of a very formal equivocation.</p>
                  <p>But the way this Doctor maintain'd, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> did not ly, when he rob'd <hi>Eſau</hi> of the bleſſing, deſign'd for him by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> wou'd give the <hi>Priſcillianist</hi> a yet much greater advantage. <hi>Jacob</hi> makes three propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this occaſion, which can hardly be juſtified from being lyes. 1. His Father, who was blind, inquires of him, <hi>Who are you my Son? Jacob</hi> makes anſwer, <hi>I am your firſt born. Ego ſum primogenitus tuus</hi> Eſau. 2. He adds, <hi>I have done as you commanded me. Feci ſicut praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisti mihi:</hi> althô his Father had ſayd nothing to him. 3. <hi>Jacob</hi> continues, <hi>Eat of what I have hunted, my Father, comede de venatione meâ:</hi> althô he had not been a hunting, and that what he had prepar'd for him were two Kids, which his Mother had made him take out of the flock.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Jacob</hi> did not ly, in ſaying <hi>I am</hi> Eſau <hi>your firſt born Son,</hi> ſayd Father <hi>Alexander;</hi> for what reaſon? becauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> had before ſold his birth right to <hi>Jacob</hi> for a meſs of lentils; and ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> in this ſenſe might call himſelf the elder. It muſt then be, ſays the <hi>Priſcillianiſt,</hi> by vertue of the equivocation in the word <hi>primogenitus,</hi> or
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:174113:204"/>firſt born, that he do's not ly; but when he ſayd <hi>I am</hi> Eſau. <hi>Ego ſum</hi> Eſau, this word is not in it ſelf equivocal, and not ſhewing as the word <hi>primogenitus</hi> the right of elderſhip, nor the birth time, he muſt needs in ſaying that, have made uſe of a mental reſervation. I am <hi>Eſau,</hi> not in perſon, <hi>but by way of repreſentation;</hi> not in reality, <hi>but by vertue of my privilege.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ſecond propoſition, <hi>Feci ſicut prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepiſti mihi, I have done as you commanded me.</hi> Father <hi>Alexander</hi> ſays,
<q>It is true, with reſpect to <hi>Iſaac's</hi> firſt intention, althô it be not true with reſpect to another leſs principal intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in commanding his eldeſt Son to go a hunting, <hi>Iſaac's</hi> chief intention was, to make him merit by this action his laſt bleſſing; but his leſs principal intention, was to give this order to <hi>Eſau,</hi> whom he believ'd his eldeſt Son, being yet ignorant of the myſtery and the deſign of God. So <hi>Jacob,</hi> having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Fathers principal intention, ſayd to him without a ly, <hi>I have done what you commanded me.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Priſcillianist</hi> might make a great many reflexions upon an explication ſo confus'd, and ſo ſtrain'd as this is; but Father <hi>Alexander</hi> cou'd not, but confeſs and agree with him, that the ſhifts, the ſeveral windings and turnings, which they make <hi>Jacob</hi> take to ſecure his propoſition from the falſhood which appears in it, do, at leaſt demonſtrat, that if it be true, it is but with relation to ſome meaning, which he gives it in his own mind, and not in reference to the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:174113:204"/>meaning, which offers it ſelf, and naturally ariſes from the words: it is eaſy to ſee, of what conſequence this confeſſion muſt be to the preſent ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <q>But as for theſe other words of <hi>Jacob,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues Father <hi>Alexander, Comede de venatione meâ, Eat of what I have hunted,</hi> they are altogether true, for <hi>Jacob</hi> had brought two Kids, which he had ſought for and choſen from among the flock; and he underſtood by the word <hi>hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>veniſon,</hi> the animals he himſelf had taken, and his Mother had dreſs'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without making the <hi>Priſcillianiſt</hi> argue any farther, I leave the reader to judge of theſe anſwers, and I will only ſay with all reſpect to the perſon who made them, that if I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, as he has done, to declare againſt equivocations and mental reſervations, I wou'd, without ceremony, have abandon'd the opinion and explication of Saint <hi>Auſtin, Theodoret,</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and wou'd with others have freely confeſs'd, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was guilty of ſeveral lyes: or, if I wou'd have follow'd the interpretations of theſe theſe three Fathers, I wou'd have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, on this occaſion, with many other Divines, that equivocations and mental reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were not lyes. Whoever pitches on a middle way, will find it inſupportable, not poſſible to be maintain'd; and every body muſt allow, that to joyn his anſwers with his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to ſay two things contradictory, to deny and to prove at the ſame time, that the uſage of equivocations and mental reſervations is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:174113:205"/>
                  <p>It is the ſame thing as to the manner he takes to explain the Angel <hi>Raphaëls</hi> anſwer to <hi>Tobit. Ex filijs</hi> Iſraël. <hi>I am of the Children of</hi> Iſraël. <q>This is true, ſays Father <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe be came from the Citys of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſraël,</hi> that is to ſay, of the faithful, whom God has given him in charge: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Iſraël</hi> in Hebrew is the ſame thing with <hi>God governing ....... Raphaël,</hi> adds this Father, ſayd alſo truly, that he was <hi>Azarias</hi> the Son of the great <hi>Ananias,</hi> becauſe he had taken the ſhape and figure of <hi>Azarias,</hi> who was the Son of this <hi>Ananias</hi> ...... beſides in Hebrew <hi>Azarias</hi> ſignifies <hi>the ſuccor of God</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> ſignifies <hi>the Grace of God.</hi> Moreover the Angels are the Children of God, and <hi>Raphaël</hi> being ſent by God to ſuccor <hi>Tobit</hi> in ſeveral dangers he was like to fall into, and being an Angel, he might truly ſay, <hi>I am</hi> Azarias <hi>the Son of great</hi> Ananias.</q> And thus Father <hi>Alexander</hi> explains this paſſage.</p>
                  <p>That all which was ſpoken by the Angel <hi>Raphaël</hi> on this occaſion might be truly ſayd, is not to be doubted, ſince it was an Angel that ſpoke in this manner; but that all this cou'd be truly ſayd, without equivocations and mental reſervations, is hard to be conceiv'd: for ſince theſe propoſitions are not ſuppos'd true, but by giving them another meaning, than that which naturally ariſes from them, and that they deceiv'd him to whom they were ſpoken, and cou'd not but deceive any body that ſhou'd hear them, they are not therefore
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:174113:205"/>true, with reſpect to the words, of which they are compounded; but to make them true, ſomething elſe muſt be added, which was only in the thought of the ſpeaker, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, here is another argument for equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and mental reſervation.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo fit to add the explication,
<note place="margin">Tom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Diſſert. 39. p. 275.</note> which Father <hi>Alexander</hi> gives in another place, of that paſſage in Saint <hi>Marc,</hi> of which I have already ſpoken. I anſwer, ſays he, in the third place, that our Lord did not know the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us, but for himſelf alone: that is to ſay, that he really knew it, but that he did not know it, <hi>to tell it us. Reſpondeo</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum neſciviſſe diem judicij nobis non ſibi. Id eſt, licet abſolute ſciverit, neſcivit tamen illum ut nobis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>evelaret.</hi> By all this, the Divines, forc'd by theſe difficulties, to have recourſe to the uſage of equivocations and mental reſervations, for the explication of this matter, are confirm'd in their opinion, perceiving that thoſe who oppoſe them, are themſelves, at laſt, oblig'd to do the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>A Religious man of another Order, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo againſt equivocations in a work full of zeal, if you'll believe himſelf, but which if read, will be found full of bitterneſs and gaul, made uſe of another ſhift, or rather of other terms than thoſe of Father <hi>Alexander,</hi> to free himſelf from the ſame difficulties and troubles. And particularly upon that paſſage in Saint <hi>Marc,</hi> he ſays, that our Savior did truly affirm, that he knew not the day of judgment, becauſe
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:174113:206"/>he ſayd, that <hi>in ſenſu praeciſo &amp; formali; in a formal and preciſe ſenſe;</hi> he did not know it, ſayd he, <hi>in quartum erat purus homo,</hi> in as much as he was a meer man.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing by this expreſſion, which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nestorian,</hi> I wou'd be glad to know. 1. Whether the propoſition, preciſely taken, according to the terms or words, be not falſe; <hi>The Son do's not know the day of Judgment.</hi> 2. Whether it do's not become true, by theſe words, which expreſs the formal and preciſe ſenſe, <hi>in as much as he was a pure man.</hi> 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not true, that theſe words were in the Son of God's mind, and not in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, when he made it. If all this be true, theſe words ſpoken in a preciſe ſenſe which they do not expreſs, make a clear and perfect mental refervation. For it muſt be remembred, that by a mental reſervation we underſtand a propolition, which taken, according to the terms, is falſe, and which is not true, but with reference to other words which the ſpeaker re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his own mind. But all this is here to be met with; all therefore, that this writer has done, is to change the name of <hi>mental reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into that of <hi>the formal and preciſe ſenſe.</hi> He argues much after the ſame manner upon the example of <hi>Jacob,</hi> upon that of the Angel <hi>Raphael,</hi> and upon <hi>Judith's</hi> diſcourſe to <hi>Holofernes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is pleaſant in all this is, that if once <hi>the formal and preciſe ſenſe</hi> be admitted, inſtead of equivocation and mental reſervation, and that it is allow'd not to be bad in it ſelf, to make
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:174113:206"/>uſe of <hi>the formal ſenſe or meaning,</hi> I may ſay of that, all that can be ſayd of mental reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and equivocations; and draw from thence, all the ſame concluſions, true or falſe. I will ſay, it is a peece of ſubtilty of the new morals, and that by favor of this formal and preciſe meaning, all manner of lyes ſhall be palliated. Every man may be conſider'd under ſeveral qualifications, or according to the School lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, has many formalities whereupon to ground <hi>a formal and preciſe meaning.</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when I ſpeak to a Merchant, I do not know whether he will anſwer me as he is a Merchant, or as an inhabitant of <hi>Paris,</hi> or as a Father, or as a man preciſely: the formal and preciſe ſenſe being, at leaſt, as well able to ſecure us from lying as equivocation: I may be in doubt, whether he that ſpeaks to me, do's not make uſe of it: <hi>And by this means all civil commerce, is over-turn'd; there is no longer any thing in the world, but diſſimulation and double dealing; and we can have no more confidence in any perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not pretend to make any compariſon between this other writer and Father <hi>Alexander,</hi> either for capacity or probity. That man's ill conduct did honor to his opponents; he apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatis'd ſometime after from his Order, and was afterwards arreſted and made a cloſe priſoner for other reaſons than his mental reſervations.</p>
                  <p>But I dare poſitively ſay, that Ftaher <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's</hi> anſwers are no better than his: that the principles of the one, go as far, as thoſe of the other; that if one may ſpeak, after the ſame
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:174113:207"/>manner, that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpoke to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of any ſin; if one may, without a ly, call <hi>hunting or veniſon</hi> two Kids preſented to an old blind man; and ſay they came from hunting them down, becauſe they took them out of the flock; aſſure him in formal terms, that he was the elder Brother, althô he were but the youger; ſay I am <hi>Eſau,</hi> I have done what you commanded me, althô he had receiv'd no order from him, and that he was not <hi>Eſau.</hi> I ſay, if all this was lawful for <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that he cou'd do it without a ly, and without ſin, as Father <hi>Alexander</hi> teaches, becauſe he gave to the word <hi>elder</hi> to <hi>Eſau</hi> and to <hi>hunting,</hi> other ſignifications than <hi>Iſaac</hi> by his queſtions took them in, and which all men beſides; give them I ſay, that this reaſon will produce the ſame conſequences, with that of <hi>the formal and preciſe meaning;</hi> and that this principle being once layd down, it wou'd be very indifferent, whether they freed from lying and from ſin, a man that ſhou'd now uſe the ſame conduct by vertue of <hi>a formal and preciſe ſenſe or meaning,</hi> or by vertue of equivocations or mental reſervations, or any other name Father <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhall be pleas'd to invent, to diſtinguiſh his own ſyſtem from that of other Divines. I will not at preſent carry this reflexion farther, becauſe the ſubject will again oblige me to do it in another place. We will now go on to the ſecond foundation of the opinion, which holds it lawful, to make uſe of equivocations and mental reſervations, in ſome conjunctures: and theſe are caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:174113:207"/>upon which the Divines conſulted, found themſelves under ſome difficulties and trouble; it will be enuff to propoſe three or four of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man is intruſted with a ſecret of ſtate, the diſcovery of which wou'd have no ſmaller conſequences, than the ruin and deſtruction of the whole Kingdom, the profanation of the Churches and Altars, and the total overthrow of the true Religion; this perſon is interrogated by a ſpy, or by a traitor, whom he knows to be ſuch, and that he is beſides a cunning skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful knave, of a deep inſight, and infinitly penetrating into things. The circumſtances are ſuch, that if he ſeems to heſitat, boggle, or elude him; in a word, if he do's not clearly, and poſitively ſay, <hi>it is not ſo,</hi> there needs no more, to make this traitor diſcover what he wou'd conceal. What ſhou'd a man thus cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis'd do? on one ſide, he may not ly, thô the whole world were at ſtake; on the other, the charity and the fidelity he ow's his Prince and his country, will not allow him to expoſe them, by violating the ſecret to all the terrible evils wherewith he ſees them threaten'd. What ſide is he to take? he wou'd willingly ſacrifice his blood, and a thouſand lives, rather than betray them; but this is not now the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A profligat, wicked, brutal, furious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whoſe violence I am not in a condition to ſtave off, is in queſt of my Father to kill him, of my Siſter to diſhonor her, of my Prince to give him up to his enemies. I am under the ſame circumſtances and the ſame troubles in
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:174113:208"/>this reſpect, that he was in I juſt now ſpoke of, to whom the ſtate ſecret was intruſted: if I do not boldly ſay, <hi>I know nothing of them,</hi> or <hi>the perſon you ſeek for is not here,</hi> one of the three ſought for muſt be loſt; what is to be done?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man diſcovers the ſecret crime of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if he do's not retract, the fortune, the honor, and the life of the man he has defam'd is in danger: he go's to Confeſſion; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor tells him, that he cannot be abſolv'd, if he do's not remedy the evil he has caus'd: but the penitent anſwers, what I have ſayd, as ſecret as it is, is true, and if I ſhou'd recal my words, I ſhou'd be guilty of a new ſin, becauſe I ſhou'd tell a ly: what muſt he reſolve?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Infine, nothing is more inviolable, than the ſecret of Sacramental Confeſſion: let us ſuppoſe a Confeſſor, queſtion'd about the ſin of his penitent, in the ſame circumſtance, or conjuncture, with thoſe perſons ſpoken of, in the two firſt caſes; that a cunning man, if you will have it ſo, ſhou'd have made him ſay cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things without thinking of 'em, and which he believ'd indifferent: they are, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch, that being once ſpoken, they will give ground to ſuſpect the penitent: if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor interrogated about this matter, be at a ſtand, if he makes uſe of the general, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary anſwers upon theſe occaſions; if he do's not ſay plainly and poſitively, that he has not told him ſuch a ſin, he encreaſes the ſuſpicion, and gives occaſion to him, that ſet the ſhare, to purſue the matter. What ſhall the Confeſſor do in ſuch a caſe?</p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:174113:208"/>
                  <p>Theſe caſes then, I ſay, with many more of the like nature, and the difficulty there is in ſolving them otherwiſe, have made the greateſt number of Divines ſay, that it is lawful, in ſome circumſtances, to hide or diſguiſe the truth by equivocation, when men wou'd have us ſpeak it, who have no right to know it, and when it is our own, or our neighbor's intereſt that they ſhou'd not know it. Let us now look back and joyn to this the paſſages and examples in Scripture, of which I have ſpoken; the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations the Fathers have given of them, the practice of many Saints, the opinion of ſome other Saints concerning this practice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, the manner of their anſwers, who accuſe the Divines, that maintain it; which is ſuch, that, at the ſame time, they roar and cry out lowdeſt againſt equivocations and mental reſervations, they are notwithſtanding, forc'd to come back to them, and reeſtabliſh, under other names, the things they had undertaken to aboliſh, and fall into the ſame inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſuppoſing there be any, wherewith they reproach them. I ſay, <hi>ſuppoſing there be any,</hi> for the Divines, who have had recourſe to theſe principles, for the preſſing reaſons I have mention'd, have taken care to prevent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, by the wiſe precautions they have preſcrib'd or ſet down upon this ſubject: and this is that which now I muſt needs explain in a few words, to the end, men may have a full and perfect underſtanding of this whole matter.</p>

I will explain this in the example of the penitents Confeſſion and his Confeſſor.</p>
                  <p>All do unanimouſly agree, that a Confeſſor, interrogated, whether his penitent was guilty of ſuch or ſuch a ſin, or had told it him in Confeſſion (ſuppoſing him in ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as that he cannot otherwiſe keep the ſecret of Confeſſion) may in conſcience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>I do not know that he has;</hi> or, <hi>he told me no ſuch thing;</hi> althô he had really told it him: and all agree, that then he did not ly. In this caſe it is demanded, what do's hinder it from being a ly, conſidering, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer taken according to it's terms is falſe, and contrary to the anſwerers own thoughts and knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Some pretend, that that which hinders this from being a ly, is preciſely the reſervation, which the Confeſſor has at that time in his mind, where he has this thought; he has not told me this ſin, <hi>in ſuch a way, as that I may
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:174113:210"/>tell it again.</hi> This propoſition, ſay they, is very true, and do's not contradict what I have ſayd by word of mouth, which is one half on't. So there is no ly in this: for a ly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the oppoſition there is between the thoughts and the words.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, that this is too great a ſubtilty: that althô the Confeſſor may really have ſuch a thought yet, notwithſtanding, if he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, his anſwer cou'd not but be a ly: but that which hinders it from being ſo, is, that the perſon to whom the Confeſſor makes this anſwer, <hi>he told me no ſuch thing,</hi> might and ought in prudence to think, that the ſenſe of his anſwer is this: <hi>he did not tell me ſuch a ſin in a way that I cou'd tell it you.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he makes in ſaying, <hi>he did not tell it me,</hi> having then, morally ſpeaking, this ſenſe in reſpect to him who puts the queſtion, as well as with reſpect to him who anſwers, is no ly. Whence it follows, that, as to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, it is the ſame thing, which way ſoever you take it; and that all the diſpute between theſe Divines, is, but about this purely ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative queſtion, to know, what preciſely it is, which frees ſuch an anſwer from being a ly.</p>
                  <p>What I ſay of the Confeſſor, ought, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, to be applied to the caſe of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſecret; or to the caſe of a Judge, who ſhou'd not interrogate according to the forms of Law, or ſhou'd do it without juriſdiction: and to ſeveral other caſes, upon which one might argue after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:174113:210"/>
                  <p>The greater part of the Jeſuit Divines, and among others, <hi>Azor</hi> and <hi>Laiman</hi> follow the ſecond opinion, which, in reality, appears the more reaſonable, the more natural, and the more conformable to ſimplicity: but which equally concerns the purity of Morals neither more nor leſs, but juſt as much as the other: of this opinion alſo, is <hi>Malderus,</hi> that learned Biſhop of <hi>Antwerp</hi> in a work of his, upon this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Condren,</hi> that holy, and wiſe General of the <hi>Oratorians,</hi> propounds an other ſyſtem, not very unlike this: it is in a ſmall writing of his, made upon the queſtion of equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the entreaty of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and, in all appearance, upon occaſion of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, which then began to grow warm about this matter.</p>
                  <p>He firſt lays down three principles. <q>The firſt, ſays he, that a ly is a ſin; the other, that we muſt keep the ſecret we are intruſted with, and that to betray it, is an infidelity, odious both to God and man. The third, that there are truths, the knowledge of which, is hurtful to our neighbor, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the public, and ſometimes to our ſelves, which charity obliges us not to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, althô we ſhou'd be requir'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>We ought, continues he, to inform our ſelves of the means God has left us, to ſatisfy the obligations both of charity and fidelity, without falling into a ly. Since it is certain, that a man can never be oblig'd to ſin, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:174113:211"/>that, in the ways of God, we have always the means not to offend him, which we ought carefully to ſeek after.</p>
                     <p>The firſt means, is, to refuſe to anſwer .... it is the moſt ſincere, but not the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and ſometimes that wou'd be tacitly to declare, what we ought to have hid.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, is, to anſwer readily one thing for another, as Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperors Soldiers, who ſought to take him. But this means is not univerſal, no more than the firſt: ſince that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third, is, to conceal the truth, under ſome figure, of which the moſt common are hyperboles, ironies, amphibologies, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or double meaning words, antiphraſes, or oppoſition of contrarys, and equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the Doctors do agree, that there is no ſin in ſpeaking figuratively, which muſt be underſtood, when a man makes uſe of the figures as he ought to do.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This prudent Director, reaſons upon all this very wiſely; and concludes, that this third way, is not univerſal, nor leſs defective than the others: that it is often uſeleſs, that it ſeems oppoſit to ſimplicity, or ſingle-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that, in many circumſtances, it wou'd be criminal.</p>
                  <p>After he had rejected all theſe expedients, which had been invented to avoid lying, he thus decides the queſtion. <q>The whole diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ariſes from mens confounding a ly with a fiction, and their comprehending, under the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:174113:211"/>name of this odious ſin, ..... all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that may be lawfully given, without violating juſtice, charity, ſimplicity, or any other vertue, and which, in many rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or accidents, are of obligation for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving juſtice and the precept of charity, which thus ordains .......</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>The holy Scriptures are full of ſuch fictions, which we ought to reverence, and cannot reprehend. But to the end no body ſhou'd abuſe this truth, ſome rules are to be obſerv'd.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is not lawful to feigne, or give appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to deceive any perſon, unleſs it be for his good, or that one has a right to deceive him, or for a lawful and innocent delight, or for ſome other juſt reaſon for his good. Thus the Archangel <hi>Raphaël</hi> feign'd himſelf to be of the Tribe of <hi>Nephthali,</hi> and endeavor'd to perſwade <hi>Tobit</hi> even by words, by naming one <hi>Ananias</hi> for his Father, althô there was no ſuch thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When Men have a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; thus <hi>Judith</hi> abus'd <hi>Holophernes</hi> and ſlew him: Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> made his Father believe, that he was his firſt born, becauſe he was ſo by a right.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When it is for recreation, in time and place; for to make it juſt, it ought not to be continual, but according to the neceſſity one is in, and that the fiction is innocent. There are many other ſubjects, which give Men a right to feigne, wherein care muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be taken, that juſtice and charity be not wounded, nor any other vertues.</p>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:174113:212"/>
                  <p>Father <hi>Condren,</hi> after this puts himſelf ſome objections. <q>To take away, ſays he, all the the doubts that may ariſe, we muſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily anſwer, or remove two principal grounds, or arguments they have, who hold that all fiction in words is a ly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>The firſt is, the holy Scripture, which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely condems lying; to which we ought to anſwer, that the Scripture do's not call juſt and reaſonable fictions, of which we have ſpoken, lyes; nor ever blames them: but only ſuch, as are unlawful, and ordinarily contrary to juſtice, or charity, or ſome other vertue.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that every man is bound to ſpeak truth to every man: which ought to be underſtood, according to juſtice and charity, and as far as he is capable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive it, and that it do's neither our ſelves, nor our neighbors any wrong: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is as little lawful, to diſcover a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful truth to a Man, as to put a ſword into a mad-man's hand.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <q>There is, beſides, a third argument: that our words are the natural ſigns of our thoughts, and that by conſequence, it is a ſin againſt nature, when they are not conformable to one another: it muſt be anſwer'd, that words are the free and voluntary ſigns of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, rather than of our thoughts, which nature has given to man and ſubmitted to his will to be made uſe of according to right reaſon ..... a man has a right, and even an obligation, to defend himſelf, his honor and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:174113:212"/>his fortune, and all that belongs to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, by his words, as well as by his hands: in the ſame manner, as he is prohibited, or forbid to hurt by word, as well as by action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> This is the whole of Father <hi>Condren's</hi> doctrin, relating to the preſent ſubject, upon which theſe three reflexions may be made.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that it clears and takes away an infinity of troubles, which occur in practice and the commerce of life, for by thus diſtinguiſhing feigning from lying, and reducing to lawful fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction all the propoſitions, and all the anſwers, which have, for their end, the ſecurity and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the rights of juſtice, fidelity, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a man is drawn out of, or freed from, pain, or trouble: and all the reaſons and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, for which men had recourſe to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and mental reſervations, are quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd and at an end.</p>
                  <p>For example, that a Confeſſor interrogated, about the ſin of his penitent, a ſubject about the ſecret of his Prince, a Son about the place where his father, whom they wou'd kil, is hid, may anſwer, that they know nothing of what is demanded; or may ſay, the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they know: their anſwer will not be a ly, but ſhall be reduc'd to a lawful fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and this fiction ſhall be lawful, or unlawful, according to the circumſtances a man is in at the making of it; and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the obligation or right, which he may have, to manage the intereſt of juſtice, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and charity, either in regard of his neighbor, or himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:174113:213"/>
                  <p>But the ſecond reflection, is, that this doctrin wou'd give our reformers as much occaſion, at leaſt, if not a great deal more, than the doctrin of reſervations and equivocations, to cry out againſt the relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Morals: for, on one ſide, this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction do's authoriſe and juſtifie, all that is authoriſed and juſtified by equivocations and reſervations; and that without being oblig'd to ſeek for any art or ſhift: and on the other ſide, as that which makes a fiction law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, according to Father <hi>Condren,</hi> is the <hi>right, and even the obligation a man has to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his honor, his fortune, and all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to his neighbor,</hi> without which he confeſſes, that it wou'd be a real ly: ſo likewiſe do's he acknowledge, and with truth, that thoſe, who approve moſt of equivocations, do own, <hi>That they ought not to be made uſe of without good cauſe, nor for every purpoſe.</hi> 
                     <q>And that the too great liberty of ſuch a practice wou'd be a meer illuſion, and a kind of double dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, odious to all men, of good ſenſe and, even inſupportable, and contrary to right reaſon, and very often to the equity and juſtice we ow to one another, ſometimes to charity, and in a manner always to Chriſtian ſimplicity; that it wou'd deſtroy public and privat faith, and even human Society, and intirely ruin ſincerity, if this licence had not it's laws, to bound and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulat it's uſage.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are Father <hi>Condren's</hi> words, which are
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:174113:213"/>enuff to make the calumniators of ſo many learn'd and holy Divines bluſh for ſhame, if they have never ſo little left, but let that be how it will, it is evident, that, as for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, it wou'd be, at leaſt, equal if not the ſame thing, which of the two ſyſtems be pitch'd upon.</p>
                  <p>Infine, the third reflexion is, that however eaſy, or uſeful, this hippotheſis of fictions, grounded, upon the authority of a man, ſo wiſe, and ſo holy, may be; how reaſonable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may appear; how ever proper it may be, for the explication of ſeveral facts and paſſages of Scripture; and in a word, how great ſoever a deſire, men may have to follow it, for 'tis ſeeming conformity to good ſenſe; yet notwithſtanding, it anſwers but one part of the difficulty, and do's not at all, ſatisfy that, for which the Divines believ'd themſelves bound to have recourſe to equivocations and mental reſervations.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty is, that according to Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and after him, according to all Divines, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a ly, conſiſts in a mans ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his thoughts: now this fiction, if one adds nothing more to it, do's not hinder a man from ſpeaking contrary to his thoughts. For the Confeſſor, in ſaying his Penitent did not kill ſuch, or ſuch a Man, the Miniſter of ſtate in affirming, that the King did not intend to beſiege ſuch or ſuch a town, both the one and the other think, and know at the ſame time, the direct contrary of what they ſay.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:174113:214"/>It therefore ſeems, that a fiction wou'd be a perfect ly. For to take away this evil quality the Divines, grounding themſelves upon the examples, authorities and important reaſons we have ſeen, determin'd, or made choice of the ſyſtem of equivocations, and mental reſervations: nor have they otherwiſe given it a greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, than Father <hi>Condren</hi> believ'd himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to give his ſyſtem of fiction: for they did not fail to reſtrain theirs, as he has done his, by exceptions, and by rules, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all thoſe inconveniences, not poſſible to be avoided, without theſe modifications or reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whatever principles men lay down, or whatever ſide they take.</p>
                  <p>But the neceſſity of the ſyſtem of equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or of ſome other, which comes to the ſame thing for the practice, being ſuppos'd and demonſtrated, this article of modifications, or manner of reſtraining it's uſage, is eſſential for the juſtification of Divines, and to point out and make palpable the the exceeding malice of the author of the Provincial Letters.</p>
                  <p>To prove, that the Divines did not propoſe their doctrin but with theſe reſtrictions, there is no need to ſtuff this writing with an infinit number of plain formal paſſages, drawn out of their works, which I cou'd very eaſily do; it will be ſufficient, that I may free the reader from the toyle of ſo troubleſom a work, to repeat part of Father <hi>Condren's</hi> words, who had taken care to read exactly the Divines upon this matter, before he return'd an anſwer to the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:174113:214"/>deſires of a Miniſter of ſtate, ſo knowing in Divinity, and ſo clear ſighted and judicious, as Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thoſe, ſays Father <hi>Condren,</hi> who moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of equivocations, do confeſs, that they ought not to be made uſe of without good cauſe, nor upon every occaſion; and that the too great liberty of their uſage, was an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a meer cheat, and a kind of double dealing, odious to all men of good ſenſe and even inſupportable and contrary to right reaſon, and to the juſtice which we ow to one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Therefore without dwelling longer upon this matter of fact, let us come to <hi>Paſcal's</hi> diſhoneſty and inſincerity.</p>
                  <p>The expoſition alone, which I have made, of the difficulties and importance of this queſtion, as well as of the conduct of the Divines in their diſcuſſion or examination of it, ſufficiently ſhew, how very frivolous the railleries of this writer are: but to underſtand how criminal they are, we muſt conſider the manner, wherein he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to propoſe this Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Sanchez</hi> the Jeſuit, who is, even at this day, for the canonical matters he has trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, the Oracle of <hi>Italy, Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and of <hi>England</hi> alſo, is the Divine he has pitch'd upon, among others, to divert himſelf with upon the ſubject of equivocations and mental reſervations. I will here content my ſelf with comparing <hi>Paſcals</hi> tranſlation with the text of this Divine, without much arguing, and with making only ſome ſhort remarks upon it;
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:174113:215"/>ſee how <hi>Paſcal</hi> makes this pretended Jeſuit ſpeak, with whom, and at whoſe expence, he makes himſelf ſport in his ninth Letter.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſcal,</hi> in this place, wou'd have the World believe, that they are obligd to the Jeſuits for this fine ſecret of equivocations; and yet if he had read <hi>Sanchez,</hi> he wou'd have ſeen, that upon this article, he ſpeaks according to the opinion of,
<note place="margin">Num. 15.</note> almoſt all Doctors. <hi>Ex fere omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um mente.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>One of the moſt troubleſom things in this matter continues <hi>Paſcal's</hi> Jeſuit, is to avoid lying, and eſpecially, when one wou'd have a thing that is falſe to be believ'd true.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What an admirable fellow is this <hi>Paſcal? Eſpecially,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when a man wou'd have a falſe thing to be believ'd true.</hi> But <hi>Sanchez</hi> ſays expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it wou'd be a ſin in any man, to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat with deſign to deceive his neighbor, and that when there is a juſt cauſe to make uſe of equivocations, the only end, a man ought to have, is to conceal a truth, which for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reaſons ought not to be made known. <hi>Quoties adeſt juſta cauſa his uſendi equivocationibus, animus utentis non debet eſſe ad fallendum proximum, ſed ad occultandam veritatem quam non expedit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velare.</hi> In ſo much, that if a man, making uſe of an equivocation, to hide, for example, a ſecret of ſtate, or a ſin told in Confeſſion,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:174113:215"/>ſhou'd have any other end, or proſpect, than, preciſely that, and ſhou'd endeavor to deceive his neighbor, he wou'd commit a ſin.</p>
                  <p>And here comes in the diſtinction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of intention, which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf teaches Divines,
<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> when in his book <hi>of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he ſays, that the malice of this ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the deſire, which a man has to deceive. <hi>Culpa mentientis eſt in enunciando animo ſuo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendi cupiditas,</hi> and that there is a great deal of difference between lying, and hiding a truth. <hi>For,</hi> ſays the Father: <hi>althô every man that lyes, wou'd conceal the truth, yet notwithſtanding, it is falſe to ſay, that every man that wou'd hide the truth do's ly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L cont. mendac. cap. 10.</note>

                  <p>
                     <q>For which purpoſe, to wit, to make a falſe thing be believ'd true, our doctrin of equivocations is of admirable uſe, by which as <hi>Sanchez</hi> ſays, <hi>it is lawful, for a man to make uſe of ambiguous words, or doubtful expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to have them underſtood in a different ſenſe from that wherein he himſelf underſtands them.</hi>

                     <hi>quem proferens in illis vult &amp; concipit</hi> But by the principles of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> there is a great deal of difference between theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, that it is not a ly, and that it is not a ſin: for althô it be not a ly, yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his opinion, it wou'd be a ſin to equivocate without juſt reaſon.
<note place="margin">Quarta regula ſit &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not at all lawful,</hi> ſayd he, <hi>to make uſe of ambiguous, or double-meaning words, even of thoſe which have this ambiguity in ordinary and common uſage, at leaſt, unleſs there be a lawful cauſe to give us a right to do it.</hi> And this is a rule, which he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes expreſly, to prevent the abuſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations, becauſe, ſayd he, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of life requires the avoiding ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities. <hi>Hoc enim victus communis hominum poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulat.</hi> Compare but theſe two texts. <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum eſt mendacium,</hi> it is no ly. <hi>Nullo modo licet uti verbis ambiguis niſi,</hi> &amp;c. it is by no means lawful to make uſe of doubtful words, except <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With this tranſlation of <hi>Paſcal. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to make uſe of doubtful words,</hi> and tell me what ſincerity there is in ſuch a proceeding? it is, as if a Caſuiſt had ſayd in latin, that a man may without lying, diſcover the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret crime of his neighbor, but that it is not lawful to do it, but in ſome caſes; and that <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſhou'd make him ſay abſolutely and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:174113:216"/>without reſtriction, <hi>That it is lawful, and that a man may, without ſin, reveal the ſecret crime of his neighbor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This maxim, <hi>That it is lawful for a man to make uſe of ambiguous terms, that they may be underſtood in any other ſenſe than he himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands them:</hi> thus propounded in an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit manner, as <hi>Paſcal</hi> propoſes and attributes it to <hi>Sanchez,</hi> is falſe, and very much to be condemn'd: whereas being reſtrain'd, by the moſt wiſe rule, and the exceptions which I have related, it is a doctrin very common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Divines; and in practice, contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to publick good, nor more prejudicial to human Society, than all the other ſyſtems men are oblig'd to invent, to remedy the inconveniences to which a Man may be often expos'd, if he had no way to hide a truth. What difference is there then, between the opinion of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> and the idea <hi>Paſcal</hi> has left of it in the minds of his readers?</p>
                  <p>This Divine treats of mental reſervations with the ſame precautions he had ſet down in his doctrin of equivocations: and <hi>Paſcal</hi> is again guilty of ſuch an other falfification as I have already obſerv'd, when he makes him ſpeak theſe following words. <q>A man may ſwear, he has not done a thing, althô he had effectually done it, by underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or meaning that he had not done it on a certain day or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sanchez,</hi> in this place, do's only teach with <hi>Angelus, Sylveſter</hi> and <hi>Navar</hi> whom he quotes,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:174113:217"/>and with many others who were not Jeſuits, not that a man might abſolutely do it, but only, that he might, <hi>Without a ly,</hi> make uſe of theſe reſtrictions, when he has good and juct reaſons for it: and at the ſame time he proves, that without ſuch reaſons, it cannot be done without ſin: <hi>Althô it be not a ly,</hi> ſays he numb. 16. <hi>by which the negative precept, that forbids lying is violated, it is notwithſtanding a ſin of omisſion, againſt the affirmative precept, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to ſpeak truth: the common good of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society, obliging us to anſwer poſitively to the matter we are queſtion'd about, unleſs he that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated have a right, for ſome juſt cauſe, not to diſcover the truth in queſtion.</hi> But he proves, that, in ſuch a caſe, a man may conceal it without a ly: and he proves it by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture examples which I have lately mention'd, and of which Father <hi>Condren</hi> makes uſe, to eſtabliſh his ſyſtem of fiction: by the example of the Angel <hi>Raphaël,</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Tobit,</hi> by that of <hi>Judith</hi> to <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and by that of our Savior, who told his brethren, that he wou'd not go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. to which <hi>Sanchez</hi> add's, that, even when there is a juſt cauſe of acting in this manner, if a man do's it with an intention, or proſpect of deceiving his neighbor, he is guilty of the mortal ſin of perjury. <hi>Re bene inſpectâ eſt mortale perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſhoneſty and infidelity of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Provincial Letters, is not only ſufficiently ſeen by the little I have quoted
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:174113:217"/>out of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> but alſo, that one ought not to judge in this matter, of the doctrin of ſome Jeſuits, and ſo many other Divines, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain propoſitions, detach'd or drawn out from the text, on purpoſe: becauſe he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that being thus ſeparated from their reſtrictions, they had in them, ſomething pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical, and ſhocking to thoſe, who know not, or do not examin things to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. How many were ſcandaliz'd at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of equivocations, becauſe that theſe two propoſitions were confounded together: <hi>An equivocation is not a ly,</hi> and <hi>an equivocation is not a ſin,</hi> and they were confounded upon the falſe prejudice taken up; that an equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cou'd not be a ſin, but becauſe it was a ly; and yet the firſt propoſition, <hi>That it is not a ly,</hi> is at leaſt, highly probable; and the ſecond, <hi>That it is not a ſin,</hi> is ſometimes true, and ſometimes falſe, according to the different circumſtances, wherein an equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made uſe of. It is almoſt the ſame thing in the caſe of mental reſervations: for by diſtinguiſhing as I have done, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in reference to pure ſpeculation, and in reference to practice, there will hardly be any ground to differ, or argue farther upon the matter.</p>
                  <p>But how many People, for want of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and reflexion, divided the names of pure morals, and looſe morals upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, between the opinions they believe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to one another, and which yet in the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:174113:218"/>bottom are really the ſame? a Jeſuit, out of his reſpect and adherence to the opinion of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> frees <hi>Jacob's</hi> ſaying to <hi>Iſaac</hi> from being a ly. <hi>Ego ſum primogenitus</hi> Eſau. <hi>I am</hi> Eſau <hi>your firſt born Son,</hi> and the other things which follow: this is well enuff lik'd; but becauſe he adds, that theſe words cannot be excus'd from being a ly, but by having recourſe to equivocations and mental reſervations, there needs no more to run down this Jeſuit, and to publiſh him every where an abettor, or follower of looſe Morals</p>
                  <p>And yet on the contrary, Father <hi>Alexander</hi> paſſes for orthodox, and a Divine of ſevere Morals: and for what reaſon? only becauſe that in his diſſertation he declares aloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt equivocations and mental reſervations. But by thus declaring himſelf, how do's he ſave <hi>Jacob</hi> from lying? this is done, ſays he, in that by anſwering his Father, that he was <hi>Eſau,</hi> not in perſon, but by a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; that he was the elder, not by birth, but by a right purchas'd with a meſs of Lentils. Where, I pray, is the difference between Father <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Jeſuit; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be, that the Jeſuit gives things their proper names; that he calls a ſpade a ſpade; the moſt formal equivocations, equivocations; and the moſt manifeſt plain, mental reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, mental reſervations: and that Father <hi>Alexander,</hi> in attacking theſe equivocations and reſervations, do's authoriſe them the moſt openly, that's poſſible, by only taking from
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:174113:218"/>them, a name, againſt which it is the mode or faſhion of the preſent age, to declaim with noiſe and vehemence?</p>
                  <p>But ſince they began to argue upon this queſtion, which is pretended ſo important to Morals, it is very ſtrange and ſurpriſing, that among ſo many Perſons, who have declar'd themſelves againſt equivocations, there ſhou'd not be any one found, whoſe Zeal had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a work, able to give ſatisfaction in the matter; wherein the true ſtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſhou'd be fully propos'd, all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the different hypotheſis, explain'd and clear'd, all the diſputes about words, avoided, the matter of pure ſpeculation diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from that, which relates to practice, the reaſons, on both ſides in their full force impartially ſet down, in order to their being exactly weigh'd and conſider'd; and infine, where nothing ſhou'd be done out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, nor by averſion to, nor obſtinacy for, either party.</p>
                  <p>I dare not flatter my ſelf, that my diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation has all theſe qualities; but it may give occaſion to a more able and more knowing perſon than I, to write one, wherein all may be found. I am, at leaſt perſwaded, that I have made a ſcheme, exact enuff, of this matter, and I think the whole may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to this preciſe account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An equivocation, is here call'd, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that has ſeveral ſenſes, or meanings, and which he that ſpeaks, underſtands in a
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:174113:219"/>ſenſe, which he foreſees his hearer will not take it in: and a mental reſervation, is a propoſition, which taken according to the words is falſe, and cannot be true, but by joyning to it ſome other thing, which is in the ſpeakers thoughts, but not expos'd in the propoſition. The queſtion is, whether one may without lying, and without ſin, make uſe of an equivocation: or mental reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus defin'd?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not whether it may be done com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and upon every occaſion; all the World agrees, that it cannot: and that whenever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Juſtice, or Charity are concern'd, they cannot be made uſe of without ſin: and that even, when the intereſt of theſe capital ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is ſecure, it cannot be done, without juſt and conſiderable reaſons; that practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to Chriſtian Simplicity, ſo long as an important reaſon do's not prevail, and take away from equivocation and reſervation the character of double-dealing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It muſt likewiſe be examin'd, whether the examples and paſſages of Scripture, which are uſually propos'd in this matter, do not contain great difficulties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. whether in the explication of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in particular, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning other Fathers, did not make uſe of the Doctrin of equivocations and mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations: or at leaſt, whether his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do's not ſuppoſe it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What can be anſwer'd to the practice
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:174113:219"/>of Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> Saint <hi>Fulgentius</hi> and Saint <hi>Felix</hi> of <hi>Nola,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whether the Caſe of the Confeſſor, the ſtate ſecret, the ſecret of natural affection and duty, and of a criminal interrogated by a Judge with juriſdiction, and ſuch others, can be decided, without recuring to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and reſervations.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Whether being once ſuppos'd certain by the deciſion of theſe caſes, and by the other reaſons which ſupport the ſyſtem of equivocations, that they are not, as lyes, bad in their own nature; whether, I ſay, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppos'd, I may not make uſe of them, when I am concern'd, to keep a truth ſecret, which my neighbors intereſt or my own, when juſt and lawful, obliges me to conceal: and whether the rule, which Father <hi>Condren</hi> gives, in his ſyſtem of fiction, may not take place in this of equivocations: <hi>That a man has a right, and even an obligation, to defend himſelf, his honor and his fortune, and all that appertains to his neighbor, by his words, as well as by his hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8, Infine, whether the different ſyſtems, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter, do not come to one and the ſame thing as to practice; whether, that of the fiction, by Father <hi>Condren,</hi> or thoſe of the figures, hyperboles, ironies, and of the <hi>Formal and preciſe ſenſe, or meaning,</hi> are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame inconveniences, as that of equivocations, be not as ſuſceptible of the ſame precautions and reſtrictions, as the others:
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:174113:220"/>and whether, really, the Divines, who maintain it, do not employ, or preſcribe theſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſtrictions: and whether, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all theſe ſyſtems together, any other difference can be found, but that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the terms or expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>I do at leaſt, believe, that the expoſition I have made, of the difficulties in this matter, and of the troubles the Divines find themſelves in, whatever ſide they turn themſelves to, will convince all perſons of equity, that abundance of men, in the world, often ſpeak confidently, of the things they leaſt underſtand: and that, if a man ſhou'd ask many the ſenſe and ſtate of ſome certain queſtions, upon which they railly, or pronounce moſt poſitively, he wou'd very much confound them.</p>
                  <p>It was no ſmall peece of skill, or cunning in <hi>Paſcal,</hi> not to wade too far into matters; and to make things be look'd upon but on ſome ſides, which were ſure to have all the effect he deſign'd in the minds of his readers: men wou'd not have laugh'd nor ſeem'd delighted if he had diſcover'd the reſt to them.</p>
                  <p>But do's not this artifice, and this ſuperficial manner of handling the moſt difficult queſtions of Divinity, joyn'd to ſo many other prejudices. give a right to the Divines <hi>Paſcal</hi> has attack'd, to make uſe of the words of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> upon a like occaſion? when the queſtion is, ſayd he, to clear the doctrin of ſome books, it is the greateſt raſhneſs and imprudence imaginable, to conſult thoſe, who for ſome certain cauſes,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:174113:220"/>have declar'd a mortal war againſt the authors of thoſe books: <hi>Nihil eſt profecto temeritatis plenius .... quàm .... librorum ſententiam requirere ab his qui conditoribus illorum atque auctoribus acerbum, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcio qua cogente cruſa, bellum indixerunt.</hi> Aug. <hi>lib. de utilitane credendi.</hi> cap. 6.</p>
                  <p>And may they not alſo add, theſe other words, which the ſame Saint ſpoke to the <hi>Manicheans</hi> of his time: who to have the pleaſure to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, and inveigh againſt Catholics, attributed to 'em extravagant opinions? do no longer deceive your ſelves, ſayd he to them ... all the grave and eloquent invectives you make againſt ſuch fooleries concern not us, thoſe impertinent opinions which you attack, with equal vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and childiſhneſs are not, at all, our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions: thoſe who upon account of theſe ſatyrs, go over and embrace your ſide, do not condem our morals; but only diſcover their own ignorance, and demonſtrate that they do not know what our doctrin is.
